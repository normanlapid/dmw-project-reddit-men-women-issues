It isn’t funny. Depression is real and the fact that so many are choosing to keep it within is simply disturbing."
NLY96,h3qgn72,1045,"Isolation.  Many men have no friends. More so, they don't know how to find meaningful friendships, it's incredibly difficult to know where to even begin, moreso if you're not in college or school. 

I'm 24, almost 25 and never had an emotional outlet. I don't even know what that looks like in a healthy sense. The first relationship I had, I believe I ruined because I put too much of what I had been carrying for so long on that person, as patient and as caring as they were."
OnePrettyFlyWhiteGuy,h3qpuhd,5760,"Insecurity in general. You’re not supposed to show that you have doubts or worries about your abilities or self-image. A man is supposed to be confident, able and self-assured. It’s not okay for men to admit that they lack self-esteem, or that they have genuine problems with their self-image, as they are seen as weaknesses in-and-of themselves. 

Other men or women aren’t going to ‘bring you up’. They won’t provide emotional support and tell you it’s okay to be unconfident or to feel shame about who you are - they will simply expect that you should take it on the chin. Not everyone can be ‘that’ guy. 

But, for a man, what actually makes you **feel** like a **man** *is* being that guy.

So you kind of walk around pretending that you’re happy, despite the fact that you’re not seen as valuable or as desireable as other men - because in doing so, you would be seen as even less valuable or desireable. 

**TL:DR;** If you feel like shit and are insecure, it’s bad; but if you display that you feel like shit and are insecure - it’s even worse. 

Fuck. I’ve never really been able to put that feeling into words before, but that felt insanely good to get off my chest."
ekimlive,h3ptya8,14555,"Isolation. I've felt this myself, and I've done some reading about it. Men tend to become more isolated and lonely as they get older. After a certain point they don't make an effort to gain friendships and tend to shy away from any type of social engagement. I feel this way, because as of right now, I don't have a close male friend. At least not someone I can talk to about things going on with me personally. I know a lot of people, but I'm less and less engaged with them as each year passes. It concerns me as of late, because I don't want to end up a hermit, but without a solid relationship, I could see myself headed this direction in my older years."

Ok_Mathematician2087,h3p9tsd,3387,"Emotional abuse of men.  My BF suffered that in both his marriages and I am SO CAREFUL to not say or do anything that could make him feel the way they made him feel.

It is damn near impossible to find good childcare.  My female work friends volunteer but then bail at the last minute.  I'm looked at as a threat by husbands of my son's classmate parents.  I find that I'm often the only guy at the playground and get sideways glances from the cliques of women who go there.  If I hire a babysitter I have to make sure I'm overly-cautious about respecting boundaries (if I'm even able to have a babysitter watch my child).  Also, the normal competition among female mothers gets amplified and I'm often looked-down on as a parent.  I don't fit in with working guys who just want to go out and get a beer because I have a child to take care of and women often reject me on online dating sites simply because I have a child.

I love my son and would do anything in the world for him.  I feel like I've done a lot, but men in my situation have zero to little support or infrastructure to manage as a single, full-time parent in society.  Men can be just as good parents as women and society needs to normalize this pronto.

Nobody did anything when she was attacking him.

Commander_Shepard_,h3p97g1,6723,"Lack of purpose and direction in life. Not necessarily a male only deal, but still, I see it everywhere and it should be discussed.

I see so many threads on forums and boards where people are looking for basic fucking life advice, where to go, what to do with their life, how to ""be happy like everybody else,"" acting as though something is inherently wrong with them, because our culture expects you to sort of go along with all of it, but I say, you know what, these are completely normal, rational, and expected reactions given the circumstances. I don't want to be a ""doomer"" or a Late-stage capitalist, collapsology kind of guy, but I am seeing these sentiments and opinions communicated online to others much more than in the past, both on Reddit and other forums of discussion, and it reflects an alarming trend for young people in general. The older generations will, for the first time in history, probably have lived better lives than their successors will. 

Parents in the Gen X generation did so poorly, on the whole, in preparing kids for their adult lives. I'm not much better myself. I see young people and they seem abjectly hopeless, and why the fuck would they not be? You can go online and hear, not just from sociologists and experts on formal plaforms like IamAs and TEDTalks and podcasts and shit, but also regular people like you and I, randoms on the internet, on discussion forums like you are on now, talking how going to college, once seen as a panacea that provided all with their complete future happiness, success, and stability, is no longer a guarantor of anything. At all. Rather, it has been entirely corrupted into a sort of unspoken requirement to make the bare minimum to even live comfortably in the United States. 

And for what? To work in a white collar job which is increasingly being bullshittized and generally unfulfilling and unstimulating (read David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs, it's enlightening) so one can pay a mortgage or rent and medical /car expenses. And sure, you COULD go into trades, which is usually the alternative option internet denizens will give you when you ask about this subject, but that requires just as much commitment to another job and it's associated apprenticeship, but often in physically demanding and hazardous circumstances that take a great toll later in life on top of the existing stresses of having a job. And if you do decide to follow your passion, perform something fulfilling? Like, say, work at a Food Bank non-profit or tending to sick children in the remote jungles of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, or something like that? You'll make less, something Graeber also noted from studies cited in his book. There is literally a negative correlation with statistics and mathematics backing it. One would think the teachers should be paid more for their work, given the effects they have on society, but alas.

On top of that, we are so overworked that just taking the time to meet people, make friends, keep hobbies, take in experiences, is impossible, and between all of this, the world is descending into political insanity (it's baffling that there are STILL people in the United States waving Trump Flags, nearly a year after the election finished, nationalism and authoritarianism is on the rise, dooming us to the same mistakes of the past) and the environment is getting worse, with worse storms, heatwaves, droughts, pollution, etc. How do you even have the desire to buy a house of you're not sure it will be there in 20 years due to coastal flooding, crime, or a firestorm? I have literally heard people refuse to have children because they fear for the future. Dwell on that for but a moment to think of the profoundness of that.

Those reading this of the younger stripe can easily recall multiple instances of their parents badgering and pestering them to just go out and just go get more friends, as if they were choosing to be this way, as if we were just going to act as though the old theory of spontaneous disease generation were relevant for depression, anxiety, and melancholy, rather than a byproduct of our maligned, bullshit society? But when do you meet with others? I spend much of my weekend  doing chores and obtaining groceries and supplies. How, where? Have you been on Meetup? Do you know how much of a chore it is to go on NextDoor and sift through a thousand posts of conspiratorial bullshit and lost dogs to find an active group, or perhaps drive to a library/community center to look at a bulletin board to try and find like minded individuals to do...ANYTHING? You'll notice the interesting hobby groups cater mostly to older people and focus on the world and what it offers, while the younger groups are fantasy/gaming groups, and drinking groups. Now why ever might that be? And then, if you decide to pick a group they have to rely on the others to commit to showing up, who might not because, you know, the reasons above. 

Of course, there's also the looming thought of the future and it's generally...awful...outlook. Young people are rightly concerned about the world and the future, but older people literally could not care less, often joking brazenly how it's >>our<< problem, not theirs, we'll ""figure it out"", because you know, they'll be dead and what the hell are you going to do about it, sue a dead generation of people? Young folks WANT to make sure we stop burning coal and they WANT to end homelessness and make sure everyone can go to the doctor without fearing crippling debt, but they are tired and so busy keeping their shit together that they either can't make change for fear of losing everything (who wants to risk their job, their children's future, financial stability by getting arrested at a protest? It only takes one felony to end up like Jean Valjean, always trying to redeem yourself from an uncaring society that seeks to punish you always). Or if they actually DO manage to get out of the crab bucket, they just end up exacerbating the problem, saying ""fuck you, I got mine,"" because you know, they worked hard, so pull yourself up by your bootstraps like me, you lazy bastard, even though those strips of leather are getting older, thinner, and weaker every year.

I can absolutely see a sort of Hikkomori class coming up within the coming two decades, the economists and eggheads and internet denizens call them NEETS, but I can see them becoming more common as more young people say ""Why bother? I don't want to work in an office/like a slave my entire life."" and they just stop caring. And it's not because they want to play video games and be lazy (although I imagine escapism, fantasy, and wanderlust is certainly something that is chased), but because the expected life paths that the average Gen Z and Millennial faces lead to zero fulfillment, if you can even manage to achieve them (and it is harder and harder every year to just get basics like housing, medical, education, etc., regardless of where you go)"
HiPlainsDrifter14,h3qv44z,405,"Society doesn't seem to support a man who is without a job. There is pressure and programming for a male to be a breadwinner and no sympathy for when they want to be a house-dad. 

Reason for my rant: My brother left a job due to a health issue.  He has a 4yr old boy.  His wife makes better money than him and they are financially secure.  He worked too much which probably led to the health issue.  I told him to take his time and heal.  If he felt that urge to 'provide' that he could take over the house duties and give the nanny the summer off to connect with his son.  I shared with him that I had been laid off a few times and each time I rushed back to getting a job even though we were secure enough because of the guilt I felt everyday of not 'providing'.   He took the advice, I could see him smiling more, he started a garden with his boy, he cooked every meal and realized he loved to cook.  I was happy to see him being happy again. Enter my brother's wife who says to us, ""I'm the only bread winner now.  I am so stressed out having to provide for this family by myself."" I saw the happiness drain from him and anxiety filled that place. He is now set to start the same job he had prior just appease the guilt he has from not 'earning'.  The guilt was confirmed by his wife's statement on top of the male programming of not contributing unless he is making money.    

TLDR:  Men don't need to be pressured to earn or be the bread winner.  Society has already told us we are not contributing unless we are making money.

Loneliness due to how men are socialized regarding making close friendships and sharing their emotions.

Mental health issues exacerbated by (1) loneliness and the lack of a support network and (2) men being socialized to believe that they can't share emotions, that certain emotions are a form of weakness, and being met by ridicule and a lack of validation in some circles.

Being vulnerable to radicalization, partly due to loneliness.

For a female to initiate sex, she'll say ""do you want to have sex?"" And you damn well better, right now, or there's something wrong with you. 

Not wanting sex, as a man, can often result in either being insulted, or spending the night trying to reassure your partner that there's nothing wrong with her.

stopthecirclejerc,h3q04cr,196,"I think that the time tables of adulthood being pushed back for millennials and generation Z, will lead to increased depression, addiction and suicide amongst men.

What I mean is this - as the 'benchmarks' of adulthood -- like marriage, children, home ownership, career growth, savings, etc -- are all happening later for millennials and zoomers, than the prior generations, there is a greater likelihood of becoming 'lost' in your 20s and early 30s.

To a certain extent, a mortgage, a marriage and a child 'ground' you -- strip you of free-time and ability to enjoy recreational or habitual usage of drugs. You focus more on career, and earnings, and savings. This isn't to say you become 'happier' in all regards, but - well, 'grounded'. 

The depressive nature as well will be amplified when a generation of 28-35 yearold men, look around on social media and see their classmates now flourishing in houses, with children, and taking the 'best' pictures of their life. When the majority are unmarried and not house owners, I find suicide and depressions rates will skyrocket.

thedevilyoukn0w,h3qbkgg,44,"A few things that need to end:

Treating men as perverts - when I went through the Faculty of Education to become a teacher, my faculty advisor took me aside and told me that she had to ""see if I was grooming students"" because it's something they have to look for with male elementary school teachers. There was no similar test for female teacher candidates. I didn't borrow $70,000 for my degrees to go perving on 12 year old girls.

The ""small dick energy"" thing - every body is different. Some people are skinny, some people are tall, and some people have a small penis. I know men who are terrified to change in a dressing room because they've been shamed all their lives, and this needs to stop. And guys who have overly large penises sometimes don't get to enjoy everything they could be enjoying. It's not what you're packing, it's how you use it.

Treating fathers as babysitters - I'm not a babysitter. I'm a father. I contributed DNA to create that child, so don't tell people that I'm babysitting while you go out for the evening. You can call it bonding, father-son time, or daddy-daughter day, but don't call it babysitting.

Crying is feminine - I have taught boys who were told that they were ""girls"" if they cried, even if they were hit in the nose with a volleyball. Crying is natural, it is normal, and we have to start teaching boys that crying doesn't make them less masculine."

Generations above had stricter more authoritarian parents, but they where guided into careers, marriage and the housing market. Some of us in our age group had parents who seriously had no care in the world, fed our egos a little because it was easier and we where left with nothing. Given no financial support after 18 because our parents where not financially stable themselves, no real emotional guidance, never even taught how to shave.

- mens support services for the disenfranchised (by that I mean services that cater to men as well as women that are homeless/hungry/in need of help). 

- selective service registration - this is the roster of people that will be forced to choose to die in a war or go to jail in the event of a war where a draft is implemented. Women have zero requirement to register. Failure to register leads to a host of penalties for men that women are not subject to. 

- opportunities for education funding and education support. 

- discrepancy and gender discrimination early on in men's careers - women out earn men on average in their early careers with the same education level and experience, why is that - though this flips when you hit your 30s as men will start to earn more - it's the early career discrepancy I'm concerned about personally.

Traditionally a lot of women's health issues have been overlooked, women died of childbirth at unheard of rates and even today, I acknowledge the grotesque sexism of a lot of doctors.

But in a lot of cases now it is men's health that is overlooked. The rate of prostate cancer in men is much higher than the rate of breast cancer in women but more money goes into breast cancer research and there is far more ""awareness."" I get that a lot of it is because prostate cancer is much more likely to hit older men and frankly, the geezer is likely to die of something else before the cancer gets him, but still....

Take heart disease, it is laudable that women, who have traditionally been forgotten in heart disease research are now being heard. But it is a fact that far more younger men will die young of heart disease than women. 40 year old men die of ""widowmakers"" all the time. It is exceedingly rare for a 40 year old woman to die of a massive heart attack unless there is a congenital defect or the woman led an extremely unhealthy life.

My wife and I talked about it and her license was no longer an issue, so we decided both of us would change our last names in support of our daughter.

We went to the social security office, marriage license in hand, and it was no problem at all to change our names.

My wife was able to change her driver's license with nothing more than her new social security card.

I wasn't that lucky. I was first told I couldn't change the name on my license without a judge approving it.

I researched and my state had passed a new law making it easier to change your name on the license.

The lady at the tag office looked visually disgusted that I wanted to change my last name and incorporate my wife's last name.

I finally had to call the state capitol and they ended up calling the tag agency and ordering them to change the name on my license.

Superb_Consequence64,h3qzp7c,20,"Male genital mutilation (aka MGM or circumcision). Most people don't even know what gets removed during a circumcision so they just default to it being the most trivial thing possible, like ""just a flap of skin"". What I have found to be true is the exact opposite. The frenulum and the ridge band area are extremely sensitive, functional, erogenous zones of the penis.  I am a man who was circumcised as an infant and I would never have done this to myself, I would never have consented to this.

A genital modification surgery where specialized tissues are removed may entirely be something for some men. But I not one of those men, I am not a penis mod kind of guy and this is never something I would have ever wanted for myself unless there was some dire, dire medical need.

Over half of circumcisions are permofrmed on infants with ZERO anesthetic (because it is unsafe to give infants general anesthesia) and if you truly want to be scarred for life, go watch a video of a circumcision which you can find all over the internet. Who knows what developmental effects the completely un-anesthetized amputative surgery to the mucousal part of an infant's genitals which is fused to their glans (head)  has on long term brain development. The medical industry is literally too scared to study it to find out after endorsing the practice of circumcision for hundreds of years as a ""cure"" to masturbation which they used to think caused blindness.

I identify as mutilated and need to live the rest of my life traumatized and what can only be described as severe body dysmorphia. If an adult gives informed consent, that's one thing, but there was absolutely no reason this permanent genital modification procedure needed to be done on me as an infant. If you are a circumcised man and want some idea of it, have you ever wondered why the tiny amount of remaining mucosal inner foreskin tissue between your  scar and your glans (head) feels so good? About 80% of the rest of it is what got removed in a circumcision. To me what is going on right now is an atrocity and a human rights crisis of gigantic proportions."

Alundra828,h3q2v6q,40,"1. Males are infinitely more disposable. Nobody cares if you're down on your luck, often times there are points in a mans life where there is nobody that cares about you, or how you're doing.
2. The ridiculous amount of assumed knowledge to perform the role of a man is completely unattainable for a lot of people, especially for men with under privileged childhoods.
3. Men are much more likely to be depressed/suicidal. They are up to 4 times more likely to be suicidal.
4. Male relationships are much more difficult to form, and if they grew up socially stunted, and relationships formed are almost always destructive
5. Men are expected to be stoic, and accept abuses, torment, and ridicule on a daily basis. Meaning that they are just expected to absorb all of these abuses and 'man up'.
6. The burden of a man to be 'reliable' sounds simple enough, but it is actually a feat that will occupy the majority of a mans life, and requires decades of productiveness, learning and experience to get right.
7. The expectation of a man to be strong, rational, intelligent or look a certain way is just expected as the minimum, while for females hitting any of those is empowering and worth celebration. This is seen by men who do this stuff for breakfast, which makes them resentful.
8. Men have to watch what they do/say around children and everyone, in case they're misconstrued as creepy or predatory. Which itself, assumes a lot of social knowledge, again not attainable by a lot of men. Social stigma around crossing these boundaries sticks for decades, even if it was a proven false accusation.
9. Loneliness in males is so prevalent, because Men have been paralysed into it due to social pressures through social media, the casual nature of relationships, and warped views of women presented to men by women themselves.
10. There is no support for a down on his luck male. If you bottom out, you're stuck there. You have to work yourself out. If you don't absolutely succeed at life, you're a loser, and nobody wants anything to do with you.
11. Our very biological impulses, emotions that we are born with, and have to deal with through teenage and young adult years, are ostracised and suppressed by our society. Leaving a lot of men confused, and angry about where to vent these feelings. Our institutions do not cater for these men who define themselves in this period, they just reject them, and let them fend for themselves.
12. Most men can go decades without receiving praise of any kind from the opposite, or the same sex. Leading to a poor self image, and low confidence.
13. We have to watch the media constantly show us the successes that we fail to attain, and others seemingly attain effortlessly, while also posing an us vs them mentality. This fosters a lot of resentment and radicalism as men with no purpose, search for a purpose, and a direction to vent their passion"

Ribajack,h3rtuv1,7,"Okay so I usually only browse Reddit, without posting or voting but I made an account real fast so I can input here:

I am a male survivor of female abuse for the entirety of my childhood. My older sister attacked me and my little brother almost every day of our lives the moment our parents left for work.

I... have been trying to type this out for literally 2 hours. Whenever I talk about this, I'm afraid people won't believe me, so I try to type out long explanations of the specific abuses I suffered. This is because my entire life, no one believed me or my little brother.

We told parents, teachers, cops. Not once did anyone come to our defense. At best, they assumed we did something to antagonize her into attacking us, and would punish all three of us as some sort of blanket solution to the issue. Even as I type this I'm afraid that people on the internet reading this will also make this assumption.

My sister was mentally unwell, and this manifested in explosive, violent anger and what I view as a constant seething sadism. We were made to eat rotten food, take medicine she found in the cabinets, clean the house for her so she could take credit for it .. and if we refused there were punishments. For example, a punishment for gagging while being made to bite into a whole, slightly rotten tomato, was her trying to boil my hands in a pot of water.

I need to stop there because my fear of not being believed will cause me to type for the next 2 hours while reliving the memories and crying about it.

The problem that I see for men, is that as we got older, my sister understood that society in general sees women as only being capable of being the victims of a domestic abuse situation. She used that against us. She lied to the police multiple times about us attacking her. She once even used the bruises she got on her arms and legs as evidence that I attacked her. She got those bruises by punching and kicking through my bedroom door as I was pressed against it from the inside.

**I am begging anyone who reads this to please, please please just fucking believe this internet stranger for a moment and consider what I have to say without dismissing it... please...**

God, how do I even say this without coming off like a fucking asshole?

I need to point out I'm a very left-wing progressive type of person. A lot of my female friends would say things like ""believe women"" a while back with the ""me too"" movement. And I desperately **want** to believe anyone who comes out as a victim of abuse. **I myself** know what it's like to tell people you were abused and not have anyone believe you, or if they believe you, just simply not care about it. So I **WANT** to instantly believe people who say they were abused.

But because I was the victim of a *FEMALE* abuser, I dealt with the both the beatings and the traumatic experiences *AND* false accusations of being the person hurting someone, so I CAN'T just believe accusations.

I tend to tell people this and they freak out on me like what I'm saying is unreasonable, and that always makes me think that they too don't believe me when I say a woman really, really badly abused me all my life. It's like they hear my situation, but it doesn't sink in for them that women are not paragons of morality. That women are people too, and people ALL have dark sides. Women ALSO can be cheaters, abusers, liars...

And I see this everywhere. Maybe I'm just very sensitive to it because of my history, but I find posts about how ""men are trash"" as very fucking triggering. It triggers this whole defensive reaction in my head where I remember how I never fucking deserved any of the pain I went through, and how I didn't do anything to deserve being seen as trash. I've never fucking hurt anyone like I've been hurt and  .... Fuck I'm crying again. Fuck. I can't finish this.

This happens every time. I try to explain and I just spend 4 hours typing and breaking down into tears a few hours before I have to wake up for work. All because I tried talking about my abuse again.

Point is, as much of a progressive lefty I am, my history doesn't fit in with the rhetoric of many of my lefty friends, and especially my lefty fem friends. Generalizations about how men are trash or selfish or abusive or all cheaters or whatever, basically any type of negative generalization of men, or positive generalization of women causes me a lot of emotional distress because I feel like even my friends don't or wouldn't believe or care about the things I went through. I just wish people would talk less in these generalizations about ""men are this"" and ""women are that"" and just talk about ""some people are x"".

I've literally been told I'm ""taking up space"" from female victims of abuse somehow by ... existing as a male survivor and talking about it I guess... Idk... I'm tired. It's 2am where I'm at so ... I need to sleep. At this point I'm crying myself to exhaustion lol.

&#x200B;

I'm guessing this post will either be ignored for the most part, or maybe someone will try to explain why I'm wrong. I just hope they do so patiently cuz I'm vulnerable here. Please be kind to me on this. Thank you."

&#x200B;

I am very short and could care less about being short... many men are depressed over their shortness...I am shorter than most of the men who are upset about being short.

I am in my 30's but never had a girl in my life, not even a date.. am I disappointed? yes.. but not angry or upset like those who call themselves ""incels""(is that a derogatory term?..idk)..the ones who wage war against women because they are angry at them. That's so weird to me.   


I have no in person real life friends, never have. I was rejected throughout childhood and high school..I was bullied in elementary school but rejected in high school. However, MOST of it(the high school part) has to do with the way I acted. I have always been immature and socially awkward..so my personality has been a turn off, especially when I act inappropriately (I am on the autism spectrum but no one I went to school with knows that). I am not angry. I do not blame other people for my issues or situations."

shroom2021,h3snw6e,5,"A few in order of how annoying they can be

1.  Being affectionate with my children is viewed as strange or even predatory.  Something I am always conscious of.

2.  If I am not able to provide I am worthless as a human being.  My value is directly derived from my ability to succeed.

3.  Number 2 causes me to worry about whether the people in life would still feel the same way about me if I lost my ability to provide.  The fear of abandonment following failure is very real.  

4.  I'm also a big guy.  6'3"" and 240lbs of mostly muscle with a prominent scar on my forehead.  Yes my hobbies are usually violent in nature (hema, sca, buhurt, wolin), but actual violence is something that makes me ill.   Even after 6 years in the military if I watch someone hurt another out of anger I want to vomit.  
Regardless I am often treated as though I am prone to harming others.  

5.  Voicing any of these outside of the anonymous nature of the internet is met with rolled eyes and shrugs.  

6. Crying makes people around me feel more awkward than anything else(except for my partner).  So in the very rare occasions that it has happened I suddenly find myself ""left alone to sort things out"".  
I'm not sure if it's related, but I also rarely cry regardless of how I am feeling.  Hell, there are times when I want to cry, but just can't."

Men are expected to make every birthday, every anniversary (sometimes multiple anniversaries), every Valentine's Day, every Christmas, every Mother's day if she has a kid, and a bunch of other random days throughout the year ""special.""  And while ""special"" varies for every woman, the bar is rarely low.  If you're lucky, she's okay with gifts that are just a little more expensive than you can really afford.  If you're not, she may expect you to plan a whole fancy date, or create some kind of artwork for her, or some other dramatic, expensive and/or time-consuming gesture.

And even if it's not a ""special"" day, there are still expectations to be met.  Again it varies.  It may be a constant string of compliments, or an insistence that you spend all your free time with her, or even just sex whenever *she* wants it and at no other time.

And you have to keep switching things up or else it gets boring and the spark goes out of your relationship and she leaves you for someone who's a worse partner than you are in every way except the one thing she feels like she's ""missing.""

And what does she have to do in exchange?  What are men's standards for what women have to do to keep being romantic?  At most, passively accept sex on occasion.  Sometimes not even that.

I'm sure keeping up a romance for decades of marriage comes naturally for some men.  But for the rest of us, it's an exhausting, crazy-making, moving goalpost that it feels like you can never hold onto for long."
GravityTxT,h3qerod,13,"Rant time. 

People talk a lot about how women and women's bodies are represented in media, and there has been a huge push recently for more inclusive beauty standards (plus size models, racially diverse models, etc...), but the male side of that gets completely pushed under the rug. Almost every single man in Hollywood is on steroids, including most of the ""lean"" type guys, and no one ever says anything about it. Boys are getting raised seeing marvel superheroes, 25 year old ""high school student"" actors and ""natty"" fitness influencers and thinking that that type of body is normal and achievable for the average person. Compare wolverine from the mid 2000s move to the most recent one, and you'll see that it's no wonder things like bigorexia are on the rise. 

And it's not just body type either. When was the last time you saw an Indian man or a Southeast Asian man portrayed as sexy in western media? Or a black romantic interest who wasn't being shoved into the big dick savage stereotype in some way?

DraftyGecko900,h3qdztv,3,"Toxic masculinity. Everyone knows how “manly men” hurt women, but the idea that every man has to be a “manly man” also hurts men. Let’s have some examples.

Men and boys are discouraged from feeling emotions like grief and pain because it’s not the “manly” or “tough” way to feel. As a result of this, many men learn to repress their emotions and end up being extremely unhappy because of it.

Men are often pushed towards jobs they otherwise wouldn’t want to do because they’re more physically demanding, dangerous, etc. It’s gay for a man to work in fashion, journalism, cooking/baking, etc. And you don’t want to be GAY, do you?

Men are constantly fed the idea that they need a wife and kids to be happy, or that any lack of interest in women makes them either s failure or gay. When their lives don’t turn out to be this way, they feel an extreme amount of inner turmoil and even pressure from outside sources.

If a man is having an issue with another man, society will have a “boys will be boys” approach to it. Because, as we all know, men are just kinda like that. Y’know? Just get over it, man.

These ideals form a self-perpetuating cycle that attempts to force men to be one thing. In reality, men are just as different from one another as they are from women. Denying them their differences only makes our society weaker as a whole."

There's no better example of this than Earl Silverman, who was so harassed and beaten down for trying to create a place for abused men to seek help, that he ended up committing suicide. He was trying to create a male equivalent of battered women's shelters, trying to help men who needed it, and was labeled a sexist and had his business and life ruined.  


Women and children are loved unconditionally just for who they are. But nobody cares about men unless they provide something useful.

It doesn’t set us up to value self-reflection, personal experience, vulnerability, or subtle individuality. We are conditioned to believe that accommodating others is more important than feeling secure in our own skin and at peace in our own minds. Basically, I believe many of us feel we are expected to be highly conformal to a male archetype that has been deemed “one size fits all” where it’s almost sacrilegious to show any individuality, compassion, vulnerability, or emotional intelligence.

MrAnimeFanime,h3rx4lc,3,"Have seen spins of this in the thread and decided to post the moment I had earlier today at work.

I work for my cities public works and parks department currently. I have for the last 5 years. Really enjoy my job, and take pride in trying to keep our parks a clean and fun place. We have a ton of community events and I often have to spend extra time on parks to make them look the best they can. This whole process takes hours to days. Today being Thursday leading into a holiday weekend, I got to work early to spend my whole day mulching, mowing, trimming, and doing trash in one of our parks that has a special needs and children fireworks safety event. This lets people with special needs and young children (although anyone is welcome) come out and enjoy fireworks and learn how to safely enjoy them, for free. It’s a whole day event and we normally have a good turn out. 

My morning started at 6am. Around 8am some families (mostly moms and their children) show up to start playing at the park and its splash pad. I’m working around the park, currently pulling weeds around the playground and putting them into my bucket so I can throw them away later. A good amount of people who frequent the park know me as I’m it’s main caretaker and normally greet me with a simple “hello” or “how’re you today?” As I normally do with them. While I’m working I have a small kiddo maybe around 5-6 come over to me and ask me what I’m doing. I simply tell them I’m pulling weeds to help make the park look prettier and they ask if they can help. As a guy being approached by a small child in a park, I’m hesitant as usual to reply. I say in a happy tone “I really appreciate your willingness to help, but you should enjoy your time playing thank you though!”. Kid smiles and says okay, “thank you!” And runs back to play with other kids. This whole exchange lasted maybe a minute. 


Fast forward 15 minutes later. 2 police cars show up and they have to come over and talk to me, because one of the moms at the park thought I “lured her child over” for whatever reason. I found out that apparently she and a few other of the moms at the park all agreed that a “creepy guy hanging around the playgrounds” is a reason to call the police. 

This whole thing baffles me. I’m wearing my city uniform, and have my work truck not 50 feet away from me. The truck and my uniform are both labeled “city of X” and you can easily tell I’m a city worker as we all wear the same colors. 

This type of thing happens all the time, to a lot of us guys at work. It actually happens so often that whenever the police are called for instances like this, dispatch does in fact ask if the people in question are city workers. However dispatch (as they should) always send somebody out to check things out regardless. 

After 5 years of working here I’ve had this happen to me 4 times now. The strange part about it all to me has always been that not once has this type of interaction ever happened with any of the women I work along side with. 

I guess I just look too suspicious a guy to be working in a park."

aviliveslife1,h3s5ukt,5,"Pressure. 

Dating pressure: 
Women are always making a fuss about how society forces them to look a certain way when honestly it's just women enforcing that on other women. More than half the men don't care about you putting on make up or a little weight. But for men, the pressure to be perfect during dating seems to be real. Gorgeous, money, settled career, charming personality, woke and super sensible, smart.... Etc etc. This is ofcourse a generalisation but ask any men about their online dating experience and they'll tell you how uppity women on there are being. And you can't approach a woman in real life anymore either. 

Emotional pressure: 
Men have ruined it for men in this aspect. But society in general has to play a part in it too. It is no surprise that being vocal about your emotions is considered weak. Everyone says men shouldn't close up about their issues, but these are the same people who bitch and complain and judge when a man actually does it. Sucking it up is just expected of men. And simply saying men shouldn't suck up their emotions is enough to be woke. Even in relationshipsthe gold standard for men seems to be someone who can ""take care of things"" (even today).

Legal pressure: 
So many instances of being hit on by a drunk woman and I've simply turned down their offers for sex, why? Because she is drunk and even if I'm drunk she gets to call it rape if she so chooses tomorrow. And where I'm from the law supports her too, she wasn't of aound mind to consent. Me being drunk simply doesn't weigh in at all. 
Even in cases of divorce the laws and judgements seem awfully favoured towards women. Which was fine historically because they needed the protection, but now has just become a tool of blatant abuse by women. And nobody raises this as an issue threatening men. 
You can even be accused of sexual misconduct God knows how many years later and your career ends even before an investigation is through. Some men are assholes and deserve it. But my issue is that it just seems awfully convenient to kill a person's life. Instances in my own corporate experiences are plenty where women have lied and thrown men under the bus for sexual misconduct to advance their career. And on the rare instances the man managed to prove his innocence, the girl was just let go with a strongly worded email saying the company discourages such behaviour. 
Talking about corporates, so many companies have a committee for sexual harrasment of women and no representation for men whatsoever. I even asked about this and the response was there is no legal requirement for such a comittee of men. And the orientation session was hell where they said even complimenting a female worker saying she looks good or saying hi to her everyday when she doesn't initiate occasionally can all be construed as unfriendly advances in the workplace. I'm not making this up. This is for real. They even had a ppt presentation and all. so the summary for me was this. We are screwed if the woman decides to screw with us. Unless we decide to not talk to them at all. But then that's discrimination on the basis of gender.


Gender pressure: 
Men, or atleast the ones I know of are all for female equality. They'd love the opportunity. But the conversation has skewed so badly that instead of feeling relaxed about women taking up the mantle on so many things (example proposing, or breadwinning etc), their lives have transformed into walking on eggshells. Not being a creep or a loser isn't enough anymore, you have to make sure others can't twist anything you say or do as being creepy, either today or ten years from now. While still having to bear the brunt of traditional gender stereotypes of pressure like being the breadwinner or the guy who earns more than the woman. Because women themselves seem to only be attracted to men who earn more than them and don't want to be the primary earner. 
Not to mention the amount of art pieces and performances and activism centred around penis bashing metaphorically! You may not be part of it all but ask yourself of the two genders which is the victim in your head and which the oppressor? Everyone will unequivocally say it's the women who are the victim(even several men)
I know the justification is that historically men have oppressed women. Which is true. But the men of today are trying to change that. But somehow in between fixing the present for women and correcting men of the past the opinion in everybody's head became that men are the oppressors and women the victims. Even if men today are themselves trying hard to change that. 



I don't know what category to put this in so it's in General: 
A particular issue I have been facing is that I try to be friends with women the same way I am with men but invariably get judged for trying to hit on them. Which I'm not doing. The same fun I have with my male counterparts, when I do with women is considered flirting. And there is significant judgement involved too so I can't shrug it off. This has gotten so bad recently that I have nearly stopped communicating with women other than absolutely necessary. Even people who call me their friends. I'm just too scared now. There seem to be certain boundaries and expected behavioural traits in inter-gender friendships. But that's not how equality should work. I should be allowed to be friends with whosoever I enjoy spending time with. And this is an issue because there are matters I often wish to talk about but a male ear just won't cut it. And a female ear is just not there. 


To summarise: the consensus seems to be that men need to be scared to death of even breathing around women. Only that will bring about change apparently. And women who don't agree with this do in essence agree with policies that do this because it just makes their life a whole lot easy. But that's not equality. That's just oppression skewed to the other side. Women are fast becoming the villains they set out to overthrow. And we men don't say anything and silently suffer because our forefathers did make mistakes. And we are trying to hard to over compensate. But it never is enough. There is always that one other asshole and people only remember him and all sorts of extreme actions are targeted against potential people like him, but fired at all of us."

But right then we knew better than to approach the child and help her cause two grown men with a little girl instantly looks bad. We flagged down his wife and friend and they handled it from there.

,h3v2ju2,3,"I’ve read this thread, and the counterpart thread about overlooked women’s issues.
The trend for men’s replies is mental health and the trend for women’s is physical health.
Namely, lack of support and awareness regarding each.

I’m a woman, and I think modern men face a greater (I’m trying to be careful here) scope of overlooked issues, by the very assumption that they are assumed to be in control. I think that the area of men’s issues needs urgent attention, whereas the broad area of women’s issues are generally being seen to. Not solved, but seen to, with many eyes and ears. I generally feel that men feel less permitted to express their needs, and it breaks my heart for the good men. 

This is really hard to write without coming across as confused or having an agenda. I’m neither of those. I was raised by a lot of males which has shaped me in what some call a peculiar way.

My brothers are tormented by much more than I am. They usually don’t know who to contact about a mental or physical health problem, and will usually start with me. They struggle to even talk to each other, hence my insight.

I hope this illustrates that some women see things others may not. Not all women seek to hurt or use men. We see you as people, equal in all ways.

I'm not even talking wives and girlfriends, my rant is about mothers.

But if I had at any point mentioned it was my father who abused me (he hasn't ever, she's a fucking saint of a man who has struggled with helping me into adulthood when I came to live with him) no one would ever EVER think he was just a strict man.

The amount of times we've had child services or the police come to our door should have been a red flag all on it's own, but they see my mother hear her bullshit sob story (single mother, no job, father absent, no parental help) and then give her a pass on whatever she's done to us, even when I've gone to my school's principal with multiple missing teeth and bruises all over my body.

I will still be dealing with the mental issues caused by my mother long after she's dead, and the fact I have to specify that I have PTSD or that she tried to kill me before people take the abuse seriously is disgusting. 

When a father is abusive, it's a horrible thing that society should condemn and all should help the victim. When a mother is abusive, it's ignored, excused, made a joke of and generally just not taken seriously."

MGsubbie,h3qfqib,3,"On top of so many of the things listed here : The fact that there is almost no groups or organizations with any power for social change out there actually addressing and combating the issue. The fact that there is virutally no representation for the interests of the common man. And the fact that it's virtually impossible to bring up these points without being mocked, instantly dismissed, or being labeled an MRA. (And even there, there is a lot of strawmanning and slandering towards the movement, where it constantly -and unjustifiably- gets grouped in with things like MGTOW.)

The majority of CEO's are men. The majority of politicians are men. The majority of billionaires are men. The majority of people with a disproportionate amount of wealth and power are men. This is undeniable. But many people pretend that this somehow not just cancels out, but overrides the fact that the majority of people at the bottom of society are also in fact men. All the homelessness, depression, suicide, drug addiction, alcoholism, facing more violence overall is somehow invalidated by the fact that all the presidents so far were men."

xanthopants,h3s7wdd,3,Patriarchy. Fighting against the patriarchy is always seen as a women’s issue but it really has a bad effect on men too. Forcing men into narrow mostly macho stereotypes. Forbidding men to show emotion from a very young age because that’s feminism. Forcing men into a heterosexual life even if they are not heterosexual. Forcing boys to abandon interests and hobbies that are not deemed masculine enough. Forcing men towards a type of masculinity that is always dominant and controlling - toxic masculinity. Forcing boys and men to always act competitive and dominant. It’s encourages repression which leads to violence. And all of these things have a significant negative effect on men’s mental and emotional health. It’s also this forced masculinity and rejection of anything seen as feminine that results in men reporting abuse less frequently and staying in abusive relationships either with controlling women or family/friends/male partners.

salmondrin,h3s8map,3,"That the ‘standard’ path through life for men exposes us a lot more than it would for women.

I’d wager that levels of misogyny and misandry alike are very low around the age of 12-13. 

- Boys are expected to be the initiators of relationships and intersexual relations, without any formal education or training. The burden of rejection and ‘asking out’ falls on men.

- Conscription and mandatory military service, where it exists, is for males only

- The pressure to earn to provide for a family, societal expectation that you should earn more than your partner and dangerous jobs that men put themselves in due to lack of other work / the pressure to earn more means more workplace deaths are men

- Almost always, finding a sexual partner and progressing that relationship is the man’s responsibility. If he doesn’t participate in this, he is an ‘incel’ or a ‘virgin’ whereas if a woman does the same, she is ‘independent’ and (according to some) ‘pure’. This is not to mention that women statistically desire men who are more attractive and higher earners than they are.

- Should a man succeed in finding a partner, in almost all cases he is pressured by one or both sides of the family to get married (and risk divorce, alimony, etc) and have children (child support in cases where the paternity is not his, or where the man did not want to have children but had no say in the matter). The deal of marriage does not serve the man at all and instead acts as shackles should the relationship sour, as well as being a giant expense for a ceremony and a ring, which he is expected to pay for.

- Assuming someone has circumnavigated these issues entirely, if they are 35 and date a 20 year old, there is a stigma attached to this. This doesn’t account for any real factors such as that the man may have been in medical school and has only just become a qualified specialist, having no time to date prior. This is purely based on age and is seen as ‘predatory’ 

The surface area for things to go tits up is massive for the average man compared to the average woman in a first world country. People wonder why men comprise most of the suicide statistics. That question alone and how it’s framed highlights why.

It’s that “men” are the statistic. Not Robert or Jim or Patrick. They don’t matter, men don’t matter. Jim can be replaced by Paul, in his workplace, his hobby, his relationship. Men are generally viewed as disposable, and when society tells them that, and something goes wrong (which it always does), if the right support network isn’t there (it often isn’t) all it takes is one bad day and we have another suicide statistic."

By that time I was already an adult and explained to him that was absolute rubbish.

Hyperdyne-120-A2,h3sigz0,3,"Where to start? 

How about what a man's life is!

You are born, you are raised to understand that the display of your emotions is unhelpful and uncomfortable to others, so you suppress them. Your only opportunity to release these inner feelings outwardly is in some form of physical activity or sport and often through aggression. Except when hitting siblings and peers. 
Don’t do it, even if they deserve it.

If you are lucky enough, you can also express these feelings creatively. You will be awful at it, best to practice.

You’re educated to be practical and logical, dissuaded from financially nebulous pursuits (like the ones you have been practicing) that long term are probably more emotionally and creatively fulfilling, but difficult to attain.
This isn’t the case for sports, though the likelihood for success is about the same.

This education may be limited without financial investment. You will have little say in this matter early on but later you will pay back the investment over the rest of your financial life. 
Be grateful.

You are physically judged constantly but in passive ways. Size of your feet, largeness of hands, depth of voice, profile, length, girth, circumferences, hair colour, eye colour, skin colour, complexion, chin length, cheek depth, lip size, waist size, hair growth and thickness and finally, height. Alluding to a masculine physical ideal that is unattainable over sustained periods down to factors mostly out of your control. Excluding diet and exercise. You have 20 years to enjoy your peak. You won’t enjoy it.

Your work will define you. Your value is in how you work and what you work in. You will be judged on the basis of what you can provide. If you retain a personality during this process it will help you with the next stage of life. It won’t affect your earnings, just your reputation.

The next stage, you will be obliged to find a significant other. A life partner of some kind in what gender is up for debate. That will equally be loaded with pressure depending on your parents and peers beliefs. In some cultures you can be arrested, persecuted and killed. In ours this change is barely 60 years in the making. 
Ideally celebrate this annually with some kind of banner, the next day is back to business. 
Be grateful.

You will wrangle the issue of fidelity constantly. You can play the field for a time but the older you become the more negatively it’s perceived. Cheating is horrible but sometimes necessary. Sex with lots of people is fun but can lead to physical/emotion damage and baggage. Some are easy to shake, others require penicillin. 
No means no unless it means maybe, yes or pay me.

Marriage and partnerships are declarations to be highly celebrated in a ceremony that is worth the deposit of a small home. A home is another obligation with massive repercussions that you may need to consider in leading to an inevitable conclusion. Children.

You will be pressured to procreate, you will be required to pay for this new responsibility for the rest of your life. You will need to consider how this load is shared. Financially, physically and emotionally. Most pairings with children one parent is overloaded. Finance seems to fall to the men. Mono gendered couples do not fall into the same trappings it seems but this may be subjective.

You will be judged on your interactions with children, including your own. Tread lightly in public, especially in our ‘always online’ internet age. Going viral for giving CPR to an infant may enrage some. Then again these people are idiots.

Should you disrupt this family situation it could financially destroy you and shatter your connections to your children and wider family. Try not to do this where possible, but if you do so, don’t make it worse by marrying a self entitled psychopath with a poor credit rating.

You will be expected to die to protect everyone at all times. It’s best to prepare. If you over prepare you may accidentally kill a minority member. Don’t do that. It’s not allowed anymore.

If your country goes to war and enough soldiers die, and you are then drafted or conscripted, you will be required to fight and die. This is not your choice, this is your obligation. It is the basis of your citizenship in a free democratic society.

If you live through all of this to a ripe old age and in good health. Your friend group will diminish, this will make you lonely. statistically you are less likely to outlive a female partner and you will be more perceived as a burden than a blessing. Your home will be a profit to others when you eventually pass. Be grateful.

The best you can hope for, the best measure to be, with all this stacked against you, is to remain kind, sympathetic, hopeful, brave, with inner strength and dignified grace in defeat. That money is a tool not a goal and life is fulfilled with experiences instead of possessions. That family is everything and your duty is to protect it at all costs in whatever means you can. Then maybe you will be remembered and the best of you is celebrated in the lives and memories of others.

Or alternatively, rent, get a dog, travel and be comfortable with being on an ever ticking clock."

2. Overlooking of Abuse. A lot of people in the general public like to use the ""big, strong man"" card when news of a man being abused by a woman gets out because of ""oh, you're a man, she's a woman, blah blah blah"". In almost the exact same way someone could also turn around and say ""how can your own husband rape you?"" Or some shit like that.

3. Not wanting to have sex 24/7. A lot of times, men are seen as cock-driven and the one who initiates the sex in a relationship, so some people feel like they have to initiate the sex, even when they don't want to, which is wrong, yk? (Btw, ladies, partners, whatever, if ur man tries to initiate sex, but it just doesn't look or feel like they actually want to, stop, and talk with them.

My father got cheated on, then divorced. We were forced to live with our mother. She would be too busy finding men to date or going to bars that we got neglected. I was forced to take care of 3 siblings and the house while she went out to the bar.

In these communities, you’re not allowed to be weird about people’s bodies (something I see in other subreddits), and everyone is so encouraging!

Same thing with outfits, where a man frequently posts him wearing skirts and dresses.  Again with fragrance, where you can wear whatever scent you want as a man without being invalidated.

I wished that this attitude would travel over to communities that are male-dominated, because there are a lot of men that want to express themselves in that way, and that’s ok and should be treated as just another way of an individual expressing themself.

Surprisingly, many countries are still pretending like women are at a disadvantage in school, which is proven to be as far from the truth as possible.

Additionally, the mainstream media often just say ""girls are just smarter"" when presented with statistics about boys being worse in school (on average) although there isn't any proven connection between gender and intelligence (or at least not significant enough to justify the enourmous gap in grades)

BUT:

Take this with a grain of salt. The only study that seemed to actually not be made up by the most part was the PISA study, and from my own experience I can say that most of the boys in my class aren't really trying really hard to get good grades.

There is another issue to that, is that most males probably wouldn't even use the centers even if there were more of them... That's something we have to work on.

ClownMask-face,h3qw4dr,26,"Here we go  
1) You are looked at as a threat on a first sight if you approach a stranger in the street unless if you have the ""physical attractiveness power"" .  
2) the male always have to proof their value to be welcomed unlike female who are naturally born with value, a simple example is social media, you have to provide a value on social media to become a figure unlike the female who can have this value by just presenting herself and this is one of the shallow media imbalances

3) In the face of the law , regarding marriage, divorce and children usually have a favor in the mother/female side.  
4) Males are overlooked regarding the fact that they may feel lonely/depressed etc... and usually they are told to get their shit together and can't be weak ,as weakness somehow affect the male value in the society and it's way much harder to find someone who is actually willing to listen to you and hear you out, and usually if you are lucky enough to find somebody it's due to some value they find in you (ex: money (therapist), a friend/a girl who has interest in you or a friendship that is somehow was built since longtime based on standing for one another in such situations which is very rare).  
5)Male has to always be few steps ahead in a specific field to compete with the female side in that field , that is why the higher you go in position in that field the more male dominants due to the fact that male has to be having more professionalism and more experience to survive being on the low ladder steps and survive it and advance to the following.  


6) Male are automatically looked at to put all the effort trying to approach and build an interest in the female side, and that is ok, but the more and more female are abusing this as there are many male who is ""competing"" and providing so many male are losing and may gain nothing in return ,which may build the frustration, stress, insecurity, anxiety and the exhaustion of the modern dating world.  


7)The toxicity and the abusive that female can show and be more ""themselves"" and be forgiven for it, that male are not to show and be labeled as creeps , for example a female can show on a dating app that ""sweet but toxic"" and get away with that.  


8)Believe it or not, male gets sexually harassed as well, and based on a personal experience ,ain't nobody gonna believe you, so you gotta somehow learn to live with it, and if it comes down to her words vs yours, you are 99.9% doomed as a guy.  


9) being in a relation where the girl is controlling the dudes friends, meeting and over possessive is looked as normal, trust is an evaporating term and the guy has to eliminate his loyalty and  he has to be only available for her and not his friends or anything else, where she can simply can go with her male ""friends"" and he is a control freak if he asks her who they are,  


all these are just general and not 100% applicable on every country and ever culture and person, there is always variables but this is only general speaking, at least things based on my personal experience and male friends stories, and what seems becoming more and more common issues IMO. ofc there are many more issues and there are many movements becoming more aware of such issues and try to fix them , but without the imbalance in life there will be no balance, and in this centaury the scale is going to the negative for the male side."

* Any time you try to bring up any of these issues, or were a victim of them yourself, being accused of general misogyny, or that you're somehow belittling the issues women face."

I wish that men could have a role in creating a society free of gender roles. But women won't allow it. And frankly, without both genders having a hand in it, it will never be equitable. And I would think feminists would understand that, but they don't. And they'll ban you for suggesting it."

 \- Rant Starts - 

  
**Boys don’t cry!** \- Boy, oh boy how many times I’ve heard this line when I was younger. I’m 22 so I think I’m relatively young, with not much experience in this thing called LIFE. So when I was younger, from the ages 3 - 13, I was quite sensitive guy. When I was overwhelmed with stress or I was being yelled at, my most common reaction was crying. This was a coping mechanism or something, I’m not a psychologist. But interestingly at that time I was more balanced, less stressed. But since the age 6 I was told the iconic quote of this paragraph... *“Boys don’t cry !”*. At that time it wasn’t my intention to stop it, because after getting overwhelmed and have a short crying session I was feeling better... But starting elementary school and being a cry baby wasn’t a good combination. I’ve been bullied and called names for it by others... Sometimes I wonder why are kids so hostile with each other... So at the age of 13 after being raised for 6-7 in the mentality I shouldn’t cry I stopped crying... And probably at that time I stopped being open about my feeling with other people, because of the previous experiences - *“ If others see your flaws and weaknesses, then they will pick on and bully you “*. Why am I so specific about my age when I stopped crying ? Because since that time I would needed to cry, but I was not able... Few years ago my grandma passed away, God bless her soul, and at the funeral I was standing like a god damned statue... Not a single tear in my eyes, I loved her so much but I wasn’t able to cry. 

  
**Are you a girl or gay?** \- When I was 16 I was interested in rock music, and while I was watching some Nirvana concert footages I was thinking “Man the band members looks so cool with long hairs, maybe I should try it too.”. So the past 6 years I’ve growing my hair. And God I absolutely love it so much. But at the age of 17 I’ve met a girl ... we fell in love ... we’ve got together ... And then she was teased by her friends and classmates that *“hE mUsT bE gAy BeCaUsE hE hAs LoNg HaIr”* ... ugh stupid ... And funny enough some elder people were commenting the same and sometimes adding that I look like a girl... The only reason I think this happens only because they were raised in the Communistic Era ( I’m from Central Europe yay ) and at that time it was prohibited for men to have long hairs, because it was a Western thing... or at least this is what I was told, feel free to correct me ( but I honestly doubt anyone is reading this long ass text, back to the story ). So I don’t really see a logical reason why are people teasing me with this kind of BS. So since then I changed my mentality that I’ve been raised in “ Always be respectful with the elders”. Hell no if they don’t respect me as a human being why the hell should I respect them unconditionally... nah fam...

  
**Healthy body, healthy soul** \- In my opinion social media and porn f\*cked up the perception of the male body in society. I’m not saying I’m a saint, I’ve consumed this dirt for some time and my perception is messed up too. When I was younger I was mentioned several time by my family that I’m fat. It caught me off guard everytime, because I didn’t have any problem with my body, I was feeling okay. Ever since then I have the constant though back in my head when I look in the mirror *“Boy you’re still fat af “*. Back at the days when I was called out several times by my family I managed to lose some weight, and after that I was feeling better... Fast forward few years my girlfriend pointed out I’m a bit fatty, that made me think *“Oh sh\*t here we go again”*... And last year when ‘rona hit the world we were stuck home with a sh\*tton of school assignments, projects and other wonderful stuff so I was spending almost every waking hour at my laptop working on some project, this had a wonderful impact for my mental health ( and I’m 100 % sure I’m not alone with this, am I right? ). So anyways I was spending most of my time with school projects and 0 exercise and I managed to build up a stress eating habit during the first wave... So I was back at point 0... During the summer I was able to drop some weight, which I managed to pick right back up few months later in the second wave... And scrolling through social media makes everything much more worst...   


**Get a good job lad !** \- I’m not sure if y’all met this interesting situation when you want to pursue a specific profession, but you are talked out of it, because *“you will need to provide money for your future family”*... I’ve went through so many career options, and most of the time I was talked out of them, sometimes by family, the other time friends and there were times when I talked myself out of career paths...

Guess who’s studying Software Engineering now :D ... So this situation might be stressing for some or most of us. This way we are limited by other people to do whatever the hell we want.  
  
**You’re going to die alone** \- Some of us men ( and sometimes women ) lack or have limited amount of empathy... As I previously mentioned I’ve had a girlfriend. We were together for 1 year and some days, but she cheated on me. When we broke up I was actually happy because I was finally free from a relationship in which I did not feel really good, but didn’t want to end it not to break her heart ... How the turntables huh ... So at the time of our breakup I didn’t know about what happened I was just happy I was out... And few months later somebody spilled the beans... I was devastated... I questioned everything that happened during that 1 year period of our life... One year after my breakup my guy friend started to get really interested about my personal life, he was constantly hitting me with *“If you don’t find some girl, and you gonna neglect your friends for other responsibilities you gonna die all alone”*... Every f\*cking time it was like stabbing a knife in my heart and turning it around... So 3.5 years after the breakup I met a girl online during quarantine. She was the first woman I’ve opened up to... We’ve flirted a bit ( I’m not good at it at all ), she was sending the vibes that she’s down to a relationship... It looked too good to be true... It was... Because then she told me I should give up, we won’t get together like forever... And I was like, then why were you sending the signals, why were you playing with my feelings... and she deadass told me *“I’m this friendly with everyone, sorry you misunderstood my signals...”* I was like bruh this can’t be happening, not this time... but it happened. But nobody gives about these situations, they just say *“Quit b\*tching about it, man up and move along”*. Wonder why some of us have f\*cked up mental health...

Old_Mintie,h3pzd4u,12,"There's no ""The Masculine Mystique"", and there needs to be.

So a bit of background: ""The Feminine Mystique"" was a book published in the early 1960s that tackled the idea that the only fulfilling life a woman could have was as a homemaker and stay at home parent. It was revolutionary in that it openly discussed not just that women were dissatisfied in having to sacrifice their personal lives, but what those personal lives actually might have looked at. It gave a whole generation of women the backing to say ""I'm not just a mother and wife. I'm a person, damnit.""

A male version of that has been long overdue, IMHO. A book where men can voice their frustration at society's demands that they fit a certain mold, and what happens when they just don't match up. It'll be rough going--a lot of the criticism leveled at TFM was that it focused on women who were whiners, or had something intrinsically wrong with them so they couldn't be satisfied in a traditional role. 

I'm sure the same thing will happen with a TMM. It's just one of those things that men (and their women allies) will have to keep on pushing until society as a whole catches on. I think there is definite change happening, but it's extremely slow. A good survey published for public consumption and marketed the hell out of has the potential to speed that up."
lordduzzy,h3q7qfy,99,"It's kind of a terrible time to be a straight white male. Constantly you are being told that you get all these benefits just for being alive. If you work your ass off to make more money or get a promotion, your efforts are belittled because of the patriarchy or because you ""fit the part"". Equally, if you disagree with anything, ""you don't know what it's like cause you've never been xxxx"" I think the worse part is that there is little rebuttal that occur before you are Manspaining or just bias. 

Do some people benefit from those things, Sure! But most of society doesn't. Being told that you are the bad guy from the time that you are young hurts people, and does nothing to make the world a better place."

• Men, we NEVER get compliments, like ever. Like I can count on one hand the amount of times someone said they liked my clothes / said I was really funny / said I was cute this month

• Not a single guy has someone they could contact if they are at their lowest moment. Alot more of us probably suffer from depression then we know because we are expected to just hide and control our emotions and just deal with it and move on.

• Comepare this to girls who get SO many compliments, have dozens and dozens of friends they text every day. Get free validation from weak men, and there is 100% chance that they have someone on their phone who would love to come see them, right now"

Random_Guy_47,h3qs00f,21,"False accusations of rape and other serious sexual crimes can destroy a man.

&#x200B;

In my country it can be reported in the media that a man was **accused** of rape. His name and picture can be published, the victim (or alleged victim as the case may be) will be given full anonymity.

Later on when it turns out the accusation was false there might be a 3 line article about it if the guy is lucky. The accusers anonymity is preserved but the man will have to deal with the stigma for the rest of his life.

&#x200B;

I get that genuine victims need anonymity in this situation but in my opinion the accused should not be named and shamed until he is convicted, has appealed (or decided not too) and had the appeal rejected.

&#x200B;

It is not right to name and shame someone based on an unproven accusation and yet it is the normal thing to do so.

&#x200B;

I also think that if **proven** false the accuser should be named and shamed, obviously you don't want to discourage genuine victims from coming forward but if it can be 100% proven as a false accusation then they would absolutely deserve it."

Heavier issue:
Also, shelters for men of domestic assault are often shut down just due to the sociological and political climate.  Feminists often get involved and shut them down, as well as corrupt officials.  A man who even took out of his own life savings to keep a shelter afloat was driven to suicide, with the cheers of social activists not far behind.

Even heavier issue:
There is almost no recourse for the falsely accused.  If a man is falsely accused of sexual assault, and he doesn’t have the right political friends in all the right places, it’s guaranteed to ruin his life.

Not_A_Referral_Link,h3qinmv,2,"I think it can take an emotional toll to be constantly told that as a white male you are the problem in society. 

Being told you are the top of the patriarchal hierarchy and the most privileged member of society. 

It’s like if like the thing with millennials, apparently having the entire world think you are lazy, entitled, and the cause of all the world’s problems. 

Being white and male you don’t get to blame your problems on society. You get told all your successes are not really your own, but all your failures, THOSE are all your own.

I accept my own failures, but I can see how it’s rough, you’re working your physical labor job in a warehouse for near minimum wage and it sure doesn’t feel privileged. 

But like the millennial thing, it’s annoying the world views you in a way based on perceived actions of a group. Being white and male, you can say that my privileges are unseen or whatever. But being white and male hasn’t helped me in school, I still had / have to study, I have never gotten a raise because I am a white male, I have to work just as hard as the person next to me. 

Some cases I would even say it’s a disadvantage. The receptionists are always women, the Human Resources people are all women (and one gay guy). People being their kids to work over the summer, girls get the office job filling papers, guys get to go do physical labor. 

These things bother me more because of how it effects younger people. I see young men working fast food jobs and they hate it. They are the privileged class and they can’t afford to go to college, they can’t find a better job, and the world is telling them that they are the cause of everything wrong in the world. They see themselves as failures. They don’t take pride in what they do, I think it’s in part because of how the world sees them. The world hates them and they start hating the world back.

This is a myth that is consistently repeated whenever the problem of male suicide is brought up, in order to take the focus away from helping men. It is a message and narrative that has been pushed ad nauseam for so long by specific interest groups that any time the gendered nature of suicide is mentioned, this is always the first comment.

But people don't actually look at these ""studies"". They tend to use hospital data and count any form of self-harm as a suicide attempt. This is ridiculous. A lot of the studies also just count the number of attempts rather than the number of people attempting, which massively inflates the number of women. These studies are NOT measuring suicidal intent.

There is a concerted effort to take focus away from male suicide by forcing these untruths into every conversation about it. If we are serious about tackling this monumental issue, then we need to challenge these narratives and look at why our society is causing so many men to take their own lives.

As for studies: [Here's one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5492308/) and while it is not definitive, it shows that when actual suicide attempts are separated from self-harm, men both attempt and succeed more."

- Anxiety and depression are much more dismissed compared to women.

- Men are much more likely to commit suicide, referencing the bullet right above this one is a likely cause.  It’s something like 3x more.

What's worse imo is when they say things like that and then add on, ""oh, but not trans men!"" bc clearly we aren't actually men to them. It really hurts, and contributes to a lot of biphobia and transphobia within our own community.

I realize that this comes from the fact that just about every queer person in the world, especially AFAB queer people and lesbians, can relate to being victimized by straight men, for one reason or another. I get it. But that doesn't mean we should tear men down, especially not when the second letter of the damn acronym is *for* non-heterosexual people who like men! Not even straight men!

BirdDad33,h3qyu3c,2,"""In their zeal to promote opportunity for women, something we applaud, there are those who denigrate men and their contributions. They seem to think of life as a competition between male and female﻿—that one must dominate the other, and now it’s the women’s turn. Some argue that a career is everything and marriage and children should be entirely optional﻿—therefore, why do we need men? In too many Hollywood films, TV and cable shows, and even commercials, men are portrayed as incompetent, immature, or self-absorbed. This cultural emasculation of males is having a damaging effect.
			In the United States, for example, it is reported: “Girls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school through graduate school. By eighth grade, for instance, only 20 percent of boys are proficient in writing and 24 percent proficient in reading. Young men’s SAT scores, meanwhile, in 2011 were the worst they’ve been in 40 years. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of both high school and college. … It is predicted that women will earn 60 percent of bachelor’s, 63 percent of master’s and 54 percent of doctorate degrees by 2016. Two-thirds of students in special education remedial programs are guys.”
			Some men and young men have taken the negative signals as an excuse to avoid responsibility and never really grow up. In an observation that is too often accurate, one university professor remarked, “The men come into class with their backward baseball caps and [their lame] the ‘word processor ate my homework’ excuses. Meanwhile, the women are checking their day planners and asking for recommendations for law school.” One female movie reviewer expressed the rather cynical view that “what we can count on men for, if we’re lucky and we choose to have a partner, is to be just that﻿—a partner. Someone who stands in his own space even as he respects our standing in our own.”""

darkknight109,h3qyvvm,2,"Lack of educational support.

Decades ago, we noted that girls' graduation rates significantly lagged behind boys' and that they were severely underrepresented in prestigious, high-paying fields like STEM. Significant work was put into getting girls educational support and encouraging them to take up scientific fields, which has paid huge dividends.

But about 20 years ago, the script got flipped. Now it is boys who lag behind girls in graduation rates and in many areas that gap continues to widen as girls rates improve while boys stagnate or even decline. In a probably not-unrelated development, men have almost completely disappeared from the education field, especially early childhood education, which is over 90% female in several developed countries (including the US). 

Yet there is no concurrent push to help boys catch up, no encouragements to get boys and young men interested in taking up jobs in education, no effort to combat the widening gender disparity.

elborbo,h3qzfni,2,"Male factor infertility.

 I'm surprised that some people havent said this already, or that they are burried deep in the comments.

The number of times I speak to men who say that they had trouble conceiving with their partner, or that they needed medical intervention to be able to have a child is surprisingly high. This plays into the lack of emotional supports to have those conversations, but once someone in a group of 30+ parents speaks up, there are usually 2 - 3 other couples who will say that they had similar issues that would never had said anything unless it was brought up. It's expected that once we want to have a child that it's going to happen just like that and be easy. The truth is for a lot of men, it's not, and that causes issues with their partners and can be a really toxic thing."
TechnicalClothes1622,h3qzl5f,2,"I think mental health issue is a big thing, at least for me. I was on the verge of suicide until I looked at my kids and couldn’t see my self doing  it to make their life miserable. Sad thing is, there is little you can do when your family depends on you. I eventually talked to suicide hotline to cool down. 
I had a great relationship with my wife and family, but over the years I became a machine and having no one to talk to. Making new friends you can trust is very difficult.
I hope us fellow men have some common place where we can vent our feelings"

BIRDsnoozer,h3qzpvg,2,"Postpartum depression and anxiety exists for men, just as much as it does for women.

In the old days before there was a diagnosis, it would be explained by: deadbeat or distant fathers, alcoholism, drug addiction, abuse etc...

These days, dads are more woke. Many more dads are active with their children's lives and take a hands on role in raising children, and so the issue is more prevalent than ever.

This is true of graduate education as well including law and medical school. Possibly this is the result of grade school education being dominated by female faculty or demands put on young men by society at large or some other factor but it seems this issue rarely gets attention and I have yet to see any program that is working to fix this.

I have had women judge me and be rude to me when I have been expressive and it pushed me to hold it in and depression as well.

frolicking_elephants,h3r0tck,2,"Gender expression. Gender roles for men are far stricter than those for women and that limits men from doing things like painting their nails, wearing makeup, wearing dresses and skirts, etc. And if they do have the balls to do that, they are actively putting themselves in physical danger. Also, some men who aren't trans mistakenly think they are because they have no blueprint of a man dressing ""like a woman"". They want to express as feminine without it being looked at as outrageous or perverted, and they mistake that feeling for actually being a woman.

Similarly, cis gay men have the highest hate crime rate of the LGBT community. Sodomy criminalization in non-western countries is also a men's issue - usually it's only sex between men that's illegal, or if not, it's punished way worse.

_Clearage_,h3r0xru,2,"The fact that you need to preface this question with ""serious"""
Justdontworrybro,h3r0zjh,2,"It's a touchy subject. A lot of our issues are intertwined with the well being of other people's issues. For instance, I tend to encourage single guys to just strike up a conversation with a woman and not worry about the consequences and live life.

It's toxic, but necessary to tell a man to ""man up"". Sometimes you need resistance to get stronger, but that doesn't mean people who devalue you are good or worthy of praise. That's why it's necessary for a parent or close friends to have this attitude towards you to push you to do better. Not in a harsh way, but to remind you of what you can do better. Overcoming fear of bugs, better aim at throwing, grooming better, fixing how you talk to people etc.

The way I see it is like this: The world doesn't owe anyone anything. You can be laying in the middle of nowhere starving and water isn't going to find you because you were nice.

This is why it's necessary to teach people, not just men, to have a realistic expectation of the world.

When you seek something out, you bring with you the tools to succeed.

You need to keep yourself appealing and have a good aura/air about you so that you can find women who want you and just have sex with them. Have boldness and confidence in your voice like a gym coach or guy who just got to the gym. Find the place in your mind that feels great and is in the mood to start something.

It's simple and animalistic as that.

We're so trapped in a Puritan mindset that guys don't know how to communicate with the world.

The world in turn is shaped by the Puritan worldview and punishes outwardness as indecency. Look at the UK as a good example. Glum people.

Men shouldn't put up with people devaluing them as ""Human Doings"". You can learn from those misandrist villains as they remind you what you could be working on. I like to always be humble, fair, give people the mile. But, I always learn something from my enemies to use for myself.

I wouldn't want to date someone who tells me to lose weight or says I'm not her type. I'll make myself her type just to get the next person.

That's how men should look at life from the beginning so they don't get stuck on all these false propagated charades thumped on reddit."

Treva_,h3r1auq,2,"Even people who are calling themselves modern/progressiv often don't apply the same rules for men, that they think are normal for women. They want yo to NOT act like a typical man/stereotype, but you you should endure a lot of things that a stereotypical man should be able to endure (not complaining about mean comments, being ok with treated harshly, being able to do all kinds of guy-things). 

I have skinny friends who are constantly mocked for being skinny. I have short friends who are constantly being mocked for being short. And yes, its often in a joking way, yet its still some kind of micro- harassment. And if there is someone complaining, he is a pussy...

Additionally, as a guy who is doing a lot of push-ups, people (men and women alike) often just decide to touch my body in rather private places, without asking me, if im okay with being touched. Happened to me at a bar last weekend again. And no, im not traumatized by it. I just don't like people disrespecting my privacy like its nothing. 

If you expect a woman being able/doing to cook, clean, doing the laundry, you are a sexist. If you expect a man to be able change tires, build things, fix things (and so on) its normal.

Its also weird how a lot of people expect a man to treat his woman like a queen, just because she is female. Or that he is lucky to be in a relationship with her or whatever. Like the man always needs to prove himself to be worthy of her presence, without her doing something special or even something at all."

Long teaching sessions lead to them being irritable and restless instead of them having recess and time to get some physical energy released in play. This leads to disruption in the classroom, and can often lead to mis-diagnosis of mental health issues [ADHD is the usual one] and medication that isn't needed.

Women are expected to be weaker than men, and men who are weak are judged harshly.

Yet things like low sperm count and poor sperm mobility have hardly been studied. Rates of male infertility are rising but we still don't know what causes men to have poor sperm count or quality. 

Besides that, women get the spotlight when it comes to talking about the emotional impact of infertility. It's assumed that it's the women who's desperate for a baby and the man couldn't possibly be as upset as her. This assumption is completely wrong. Men can want children just as much as women do. Men can be just as devastated as women when they are told they are infertile. Men can be just as heartbroken as the woman when each pregnancy test comes up negative. 

All this holds true when it comes to miscarriage and stillbirth too. While the woman has the added aspect of having to go through the physical aspect of it, that doesn't mean the man doesn't grieve the loss just as hard. I've counselled men who have lost their babies through miscarriage or stillbirth. Their pain and grief for the child that never was is just as intense as the women I've counselled for the same thing.

Men are still seen as the disposable sex in all cultures, just to varying degrees. In some countries, teenagers have to work to bring in an extra income and support the family.

It is established that a majority of criminals are male because they are on the extremes of disagreeableness, but nobody considers that there is the expectation that men HAVE to perform in every aspect of their existence.

Overweight? You’re a slob and lazy 
Not earning enough? You’re a bum 
Frugal and trying to save? You’re cheap 

This doesn’t even touch on the numbers aspect of dating apps like tinder, and dating in general.

Since I’ve been experiencing these issues growing up, I’ve generalised the majority of issues like this:

Men’s issues are in comparison to the group, to other men. Women’s issues are more individual and personal, not as collective as men’s issues. 

This means that there is a gap where men’s issues are collective in nature (like what we see in male suicide stats, homicide or incarceration stats or war deaths) whilst women’s are individual; about each person and their story. This is why I feel that men’s issues are not discussed, and it may be because of inability to discuss individual issues as a man, but whatever it is, it’s exacerbating the issue further.

And when we take away individualism of people’s issues, and we make them one homogenous unit with phrases like “all men are X or Y”, it tells us that on a collective level, men are considered important. But on an individual level, as a man, you’re disposable. Someone else will come up to take your place, do what you won’t. In some sense that’s true for all people, but it is especially true for men."

That leaves me with zero days for the rest of the year and every subsequent day that I miss, I will be docked a days pay. So getting sick, going to the doctor, or taking anytime to take care of anything is off the table. 

It infuriates me that there is no universal paternal leave. It’s such a disservice to the newborn and the mother that the father is not able to stay home for an extended period of time. And if they do, their family will suffer financially for it. 

Being able to take leave for a newborn is a joke regardless. As a woman you get 6 weeks off for a natural birth and 8 weeks off for a c-section. And if you are a mother that cannot miss more than 6 or 8 weeks off from work, then your child will go to daycare. Which is another freaking mortgage. You literally cannot take a newborn puppy away from its mom for 12 weeks in some cases. Yet a newborn baby, who has an innumerable amount of needs that need to be met is enrolled in a daycare.

Ryulightorb,h3r8hef,2,"Hair loss - lot of men get treated like shit for it and as someone losing hair it scares me as I have had women tell me they wouldn’t consider a balding guy especially in his 20’s there is a ton of disdain

Emotions- most people get pissed if you as a guy cry or are emotional whilst if a girl does the same it’s no issue granted this isn’t underlooked but still important close to home for me as I’m super emotional to the point when others are sad and crying I will cry also I’m empathetic to a fault and have lived my life with my heart on my sleeve as that’s my base instinct.

Grew up being told I was weak and pathetic for that even now I get told it but the principal of my primary school luckily pulled me aside as a kid and told me “keep wearing your heart on your sleeve it will hurt people will be mean but be yourself we need more kind people” since then I have pretty much decided fuck the expectations of others I’m going to be me emotional and free.

Being around kids - I mean let’s be honest if you find a missing kid as a guy and you want to help them find their parents most of the time you just have to ignore them and hope nothing happens to them because most parents just the gun and assume guys are predators whilst if a girl does the same they are generally fine.

Hidiety,h3r8jez,2,"A while back, like several years ago, we needed food stamps. I applied as head of household for the 5 of us. I waited a month just to get denied. We waited the 6 month period required before applying again, but this time put my wife as head of household. Just a few days later they called her and approved us for $250 a month. Literally nothing changed for us financially in that time.

An old friend of mine was in a custody battle for his daughter. This process took 3 years and the child was in the mothers custody the whole time. After repeatedly failing to appear, failing drug test after drug test, and failing to commit to sobriety, she finally lost custody because she was jailed for a DUI. At any point during this, if my friend pulled any of the crap she did the case would have immediately been in her favor. And that's not just my opinion, his lawyer told him as much.

Getting a divorce is an absolute nightmare. No first hand experience here, but I have seen the aftermath a few times. No matter what the contributions from the wife are she will get everything. Best case scenario is a 50/50 split. If there's kids involved you may as well plan to live in poverty the rest of your life.

I'm in my 30s. A few years ago I briefly entertained the idea of college. So I was scouring the internet looking for grants, scholarships, whatever. Turns out if you're a male that's not fresh out of high school there's really nothing out there for you. Maybe could have gotten a few bucks for being a lefty, but that's it.

In the work place men have to be extremely careful around women. If you're even accused of anything sexual, bye bye job. Accuse a woman though and it's shrugged off, swept under the rug, and forgotten. And now you have to explain why you were terminated at every job after. Oh, and ""unwanted staring"" is something that can be considered sexual harassment. Makes sense, until you get to the part where staring is at the discretion of the accuser.

I've been trying to figure out my mental health for 5 years now. I've seen first hand how men and women are treated differently and let me tell ya, being a woman with mental health problems goes a lot smoother. Finding support as a man is a joke, plenty of women only groups though. And even in co-ed groups women are the focus.

I'm a sexual assault/child abuse survivor. I have been abused by men and women. I was mostly raised by a single mother,  and my older sister. 

There was so much pressure to be ""manly"" because my father wasn't around(he abused my sister and I) so I did all the ""manly"" shit I could. I was captain of my HS football team,  I became a bouncer and got into fights,  I joined the military(got sexually assaulted there too), and I'm a naturally protective person.

I'm married now and I have a son but still spend a lot of time by myself. I can't have conversations with women at the gym because I'm afraid of how it will be perceived.  I go to the dog park where some guys talk to me,  women my age stay away,  and the old ladies are cool AF so I talk to them because they don't act like I'm weird or threatening. 

I feel obligated to protect other people so when I see somebody else who is alone I pay attention but I have to be aware of how they might perceive me. 

I do however take my son to the park without worry because he looks just like me. 

Many times when I try to draw attention to the struggles that men go through,  I'm immediately invalidated by women AND other men because they think I'm trying to invalidate other people's struggles.

The list goes on and on but I think I'm done here. Yes I've gone to therapy,  it worked pretty well and I would suggest therapy for pretty much everybody."

disasterandroid,h3rbrbf,2,"(throwaway acct)

i was once called back to my home town to talk to the police about something - someONE actually - a kid who used to be my neighbour and who i babysat frequently when i was in high school (\~20 years prior to this incident). when i got to the police station (it took over an hour to drive back home) i was brought in and questioned by the officers about how i knew the person, etc.

after a while i asked why i was there and the officer seemed confused. they said, ""you don't know?"" and when i said no, they said ""this person has accused you of sexual assault while in their care years ago.""

i immediately blanched. i have a bad memory but i KNOW i did not do anything with that girl and i told the officer that. they then asked me why i thought i was there and i indicated that i thought i was there because she had been abused by her father or something. when i brought that up, the officer asked what i meant by that and i proceeded to tell them that while i watched the kids in their own home, he was frequently drunk, shouted at me whenever he saw me (he'd hired me and some others to help him with piling wood once and i quit after the went off on me), he was growing pot in his bedroom closet, among other things. the officer started taking crazy amounts of notes.

they eventually told me i could go but i needed to stay close by so they could bring me in for more questioning.

i drove home alone in terror. i got there, told my then gf what had happened and she freaked out. i went to our room and cried for a while. like i said, i have a bad memory and was racking my brain trying to remember what the kid was talking about - maybe i DID do something awful and blocked it out?

after not being able to come up with any memories of it and worrying about what was to come next - court, lawyers, being accused of something i didn't do that would ruin my life) i tried to kill myself by overdosing on medication in the bathroom medicine cabinet. luckily i was an idiot and took what would amount to a bunch of flintstone vitamins.

the next day i called a laywer. i had no friends who are lawyers and even less money to pay anyone to defend me. since i'd failed suicide the night before i'd try again the following night when no one was looking. my life was over.

later that same afternoon i got a call from the police back home and they wanted me to come so they could talk to me again with more questions. i got in the car and drove the hour to meet. this time the conversation was the same as before, i was accused of sexually molesting this girl when i was 17. after some more questions similar to those the previous night they said they'd be in touch.

i got home around 11pm and was exhausted and fell asleep and didn't get the chance to kill myself. when i woke up the next day i got a call around 2pm from the police station. they wanted to tell me that the kid, who i learned was in a women's shelter with her mom and brother to hide from their dad, had admitted to making the whole thing up. they said that they picked someone they knew who had moved far away (i had gone off to college about 10hrs from home and she figured i still lived that far away). she figured the police wouldn't be able to find me to verify her story because i was so far away. the officer told me that the girl had admitted to the whole thing and i was off the hook. the officer said to stay close in case they needed to follow up with more questions - they never did.

from that day forward i refused to be alone with anyone's kids for any reason (even really good friends). hanging out, ""watching them for a second while the parents do something"", etc. fast forward another 10 years when i have two kids of my own and i am afraid to change their diapers because i'm afraid i'm going to touch them wrong - i'm afraid to touch my own babies! i'd ask my wife (was my gf from earlier in the story - she stuck by me through it all) to come in and make sure it was doing it right, and so that i'd have someone to prove i wasn't molesting them.

the police never did call me again to ask for more info, etc. the incident just sort of vanished. the weight of that accusation hung over me for YEARS and even today if i'm hanging with a buddy and their family i'll always make sure someone else is in the room if i'm with their kids. i'm 45 and i'm still terrified of being accused that way. i have nothing to fear but the assumption that i'd done this awful, awful thing hurt me deeply."

Our emotions, problems and feelings are downplayed  for the sake of everyone else.  Like it's some honorable crusade to downplay all of that. 

We want to do better for the communities we are apart of, but sometimes we are the minority.  Like with the media we grew up with, stuff like Doctor Who, Harry Potter, etc. Yet it's just a clusterfuck trying to find our place, almost ironically because we hear so much about the crap women got for just trying to find their place as fans of stuff that was male dominated in the past. I mean it's to be expected, with how so many people there have depression, are insecure etc in those  communities. I guess I might just think that things could be better, but it must be that these communities  are sort of set in stone with being like that.  At least you really cannot find your place as easily  later on. You have to grow up with a circle of friends.   (I know this might not effect a lot of men, but it's something some other men might relate to in some way)   

Another thing is loneliness. We just get pushed and pulled back and forth between what people think is the norm.  We grow up being depressed and given flack for that, only to be given flack when we overcome it.  We constantly get told about  how bad our emotions are, by well... women mostly.  We get told that we are the worst of society, most people make us fight to dispute that. They rain down upon us and take every action  as a sign that we are as bad they think we are.

MentORPHEUS,h3rdew8,2,"**Men can't be involved with young women; sometimes not even their own daughters, without attracting vocal suspicion.**  Many a time over the decades, I've acted as a step parent or mentor, only to have my efforts and investment shit upon by some woman.  

I dated a single mom for several years, and more than a year in started being involved with her kids in a step parent role.  After investing several years bonding as a family, my GF went through a bout of depression and became irrationally jealous of any time I spent with her teen daughter.  Openly accused me of ""having too much interest in young girls.""  Long story short I had to cut ties which broke me emotionally for years.  My ex even years later couldn't figure out why I ""overreacted/made such a big deal"" about the whole affair.  She has zero accountability toward her role in what happened, as if the accusation was on par with allegedly leaving the toilet seat up or something petty.

Most recent was a psychologist friend (we're both in our 50s) had a struggling single mom roommate with a 15yo daughter with behavioral problems.  We agreed to invest time and effort together trying to be a positive influence for her.  After about a year the young lady was flourishing, lost 100lbs, and was socializing in person with her peers instead of online all the time.  Neither her mom or my friend could connect with her about online stuff so I'd often chat with her about that, my friend was even privately annoyed by ""her weird internet stuff"" so I was the only adult in her life she could connect to on the topic.    Once we were having a conversation about anime, which she really liked and I'm indifferent to but have been online long enough to hold up my end of it.  She was going on about a guy on one of her anime forums who was totally over the top into all things Japan, even identifying as Japanese despite looking 110% the way you'd expect his Irish genes to express.  I said, so is he really sincerely *learning* about Japan, or is he one of those guys who just superficially fetishizes Japanese culture, and *gets it all totally wrong?*  She laughed heartily and said yeah that totally describes him.  The conversation went on from there.

Later as soon as we were alone, my friend confronted me and said, ""You have to be careful about what you say to young girls, remember she is FIFTEEN!""   I responded what do you mean?  She said, ""I heard you talking about *fetishes* with her!""  I explained the context as above, but there wasn't even a flicker of recognition or understanding, just an unwavering stern accusing stance.  In this moment I realized my position.

* I'm no longer her peer, there is suddenly a parent-child dynamic to our relationship.
* Not only am I as a child, I am *in trouble right now!*
* Also as a child, I have no voice or agency moving forward in this situation.

At this point, I lamented that this is the reason there are so few men in the teaching, childcare, and healing professions, because the lot of men who work in any capacity around girls is to always be considered suspicious, and to have any uncertainty to be assumed as the worst possible interpretation with evidence or proof necessary.   

Her response?  ""That's why you need to be *careful.*""  With the same you're-in-trouble vibe.

I decided I had to be **Mike Pence careful** in this situation, meaning never to be in the same room alone with any of those women.  *Ever*.   This ended a 4 year friendship.  I hope things go well for this girl.  The one in the first story didn't do so well; last I heard she's in her 30s back living with her mom in a weird codependent symbiosis.

DoggoDude979,h3re15e,2,"It seems like the majority of these are things regarding being a parent/babysitter and not having support systems. That’s really important and stuff, but the abuse, sexual and domestic, as well as bullying in schools, is something I rarely see mentioned. 

I just saw a post in another sub about a guy getting bullied by a female classmate, who was acting incredible aggressive, making him step back, and threatening him, overall initiating it, but when he hits her to retaliate, everyone hangs up on him and yells at him and gets in between them to get mad at him. The title of that post mentioned he was suspended for that, even though there was video evidence for it.

I also see a lot of “men are the worst, cheat on him” and just... why? Like you realize it’s not just you in the relationship and he doesn’t deserve to be cheated on, right? You realize he’s a person, right? It’s just so stupid and a huge double standard that isn’t talked about.

Another thing that’s talked about but no one ever does anything about is toxic masculinity. It’s rampant throughout the male community, and while people go “it’s so terrible it needs to stop”, stuff like “bring back manly men” only enforces it, and people just sit by while all of this stuff happens and don’t give a shit"
Iggyboof,h3re1xw,2,"Trans girl here, SUPER qualified for this as I experienced life with then without said issues!!

Never get complemented. Ever. Best you can get is The Boys sarcastically saying some sorta nice stuff from time to time. But legitimate, unrequested compliments from strangers or even just anyone besides your mom? Nope. I can remember every compliment I got that wasn't linked to work/school performance before I realized I'm trans because there were so few.

Couple this with it being ""pussy shit"" when men ask for help or show deep emotion. We wonder why the male suicide rate is so high yet we hardly ever offer support to men because we tell them not to share it and rag their masculinity when they do ask for help. It's horrid.

Speaking of masculinity, how men are, or should I say AREN'T allowed to present themselves. We allow women to skip shaving for three months and wear grungy man clothes and have their hair short and whatever and it's just as fine as ultra-fem princess garb because ""go get em, girl, fuck the partiarchy!"" (Which, I mean, we should, it's good to allow this freedom.) But a man shaves his legs? ohohoho nah, homeboy better constantly wear his medal on his neck to prove he's actually on the swim team or else he's gay. Dude wants to wear socks above the knee? Never, not allowed, sissy hour out here.

And just look at the outfit selection. Women can wear whatever they want so long as it's reasonably professional to a workplace. But men get ONE outfit. One. Button up long sleeve shirt, slacks, dress shoes, maybe a tie depending on what the bossman says. And whoever decided that short sleeves were invariably unprofessional in a state that breaches 100° sometimes is a prick.

Basically most of my main issues come down to how men literally aren't allowed to express themselves beyond ""hmmm do I wish to smell like sawdust and determination, ox blood and angst, or wolf piss and contemplation today?"" This is both physically and emotionally, really. Men can't be ""weak"" or ""sensitive"" or ""feminine"". It's just such a rigid box for how they have to act and straying leads to harsh criticism and pushback whereas women can kinda look and act how they want as long as they find a social or work circle where it fits (ie the buff manly chick is more likely to end up on a construction site than in an office but she's really allowed either tbh).

Let men feel. Let men look different than the idealized version of a man. Long as nobody gets hurt, why's it even matter?"

MulletPower,h3refj9,2,"I wish I got to this thread when it was newer, gonna get buried. But, there's something really important that I hope the other men reading this thread realize.

Before I give my take I just want to be clear that the vast majority of the top posts in this thread are completely valid. 

I want to focus the general feeling of being disposable. This is probably the biggest issue men face. This problem is also a root cause of many of the other problems men face. Whether it's suicide, higher rate of violence, more likely to die on the job or even just feeling you have to hide your feelings to not get in the way of what's expected of you.

This is a feeling that a lot of grifters will have a cause and solution to. Usually culture war bullshit. They'll claim something (feminism ,globalism, multiculturalism, etc.) stole what you were owed and that we must return to a time where ""men could be men"" or whatever best describes the venerated past they are selling.

The real cause is simple, the expansion of capitalism and weakening of worker organization over the past 100 years has devalued everyone's lives. Every year your lives cost more and your labour is worth less. 

Your feeling of being disposable is a feature not a bug. If you feel worthless you are easier to exploit. If you are desperate you are easier to control. Then when you do grasp a little bit of wealth and freedom, your fear of losing that will cause you to betray your own class interests to keep those you believe are below you down.

I'm not going to sell you a solution, just make sure you know the cause before someone tries selling their solution to you."

You don't even need to be a quiet kid, just a lot of average guys who might otherwise seem okay really crave affection and understanding inside but are held back by insecurities, lack of social experience or the straight up disregard for mental health and emotional awareness that many guys struggle with.

If you notice a quieter guy or someone who might be struggling, please, never disregard it as more or less important because of gender.

Courts favor women in custody battles. So for a man to win the mother either has to be demonstrably awful, not show up, or not want it. Otherwise the father has to basically be a perfect saint of a person.
Further child support can run you a lot of money and if you can't afford it, you're a deadbeat and will be thrown in jail, license revoked so you can't get to work, and told to somehow make MORE money to pay it

Men have very little help for domestic abuse and people tend to assume that he was the aggressor, even when he's the one who called police for help. If he fights back he's a pos, if he doesn't fight back then his masculinity is called into question because ""a girl beat you up, really?"" Male domestic abuse shelters don't exist. In fact a man in canada tried to open one using his own money and tried to get support to keep it open because there were no shelters when he was going through it. He was told he would be stealing resources from women, who REALLY need them. Implying that men dont. His shelter closed down when his funds to keep it afloat ran out, and because he realized the reason there Were no male domestic abuse shelters was because nobody cares about men at all, he self deleted. There are studies that say men are abused almost as much as men, and that's just known cases because most men would never admit they were abused (although I do know for a fact that every man I know has been attacked physically by atleast 1 or 2 women)

Men make up most of the homeless population by far, and still get less help than women. Nobody feels bad for a homeless man, he just ""shouldn't have gotten into that position in the first place"" regardless of whatever circumstances may actually have caused it

Men are victims of sexual assault and r*pe at alarmingly high rates, but people laugh at men, say they deserved it, say they definitely wanted it because men are always horny. If the assailant is a woman they assume he's gay for not wanting it. Until 2010 the fbi definition didn't legally include men as victims, and because of this, how accurate can studies really be? A lot of men don't even realize that it actually did happen to them because they're taught to phrase it in a positive way ""when I was 12 I got to sleep with my 19 YO babysitter"" ""I slept with my fine teacher when I was 14, she's 28"" like no. You were r*ped. news articles even have different wording ""male teacher r*ped female student"" vs. ""female teacher fell in love with teenage male student and had sex with him""

A fairly large portion of the world also currently hates men as a whole with a passion and deflects whenever men try to talk about their problems with ""the patriarchy caused this so it's men's fault"" even though only a couple of men actually really had anything to do with it, and the average man had and continues to have no say in it.

But her dad clearly wasn't the a fit parent because he worked. /s  He only got the girls back after the mom overdosed the third time and ended up in a coma. The state wanted to give custody to the grandmother instead of the father who had almost gone into debt hiring a PI to find his daughters after the fourth move happened unexpectedly and under-the-radar and the mom changed her number.

I also have a relative who was talking with his now-ex about filing divorce, but because she didn't have a job and didn't want one, she went and filed behind his back in the next state over because it's especially biased toward mothers. All she had to do was tell them she was breastfeeding and they awarded full custody to her, despite her having no income. My relative now hasn't seen his daughter in almost a year due to covid travel restrictions, and if he wants to be in her life at all, he either has to drive to the next state every weekend and holiday or find a new job there and move, which is super hard right now because of covid.

Girls made fun of me to my face in public school, probably were laughing at me in college, and they're probably still making fun of me now behind my back when they see me in public. If I made a dating profile again it would probably be passed around among them as a meme or something.

It's not like I had no friends in high school/college and was a horrible person or anything. The only possible reason is my appearance. I wasn't even that overweight at the time but I guess a single micron over the optimal weight range disqualifies you with what male appearance standards are. I always found it suspect that they say men are more visually driven when I was the one who cared about personality and used that as my main criteria in swiping yet I was completely disqualified for not being a beautiful Greek god.

I want to get losing my virginity on a real date and not an escort or something off my bucket list as an accomplishment so I've been working out recently and lost 80lbs with another 30-40 to go maybe depending on where I want to settle in the recomposition but other than that this experience makes me think I might want to just live entirely alone after that instead of continuing to try to bother with people who only care about my looks and apparently couldn't give less of a shit about who I am as a person."

Left a concert (before covid) and was walking to my car by myself. The crowd thinned out and I ended up walking behind two girls. It was dark, kind of dingy part of town, and I get it. So I crossed the street and slowed down trying to avoid any creepy vibes. It was the side of the street my car was on anyway. 

As we were approaching the garage my car was in, the girls crossed the street toward a car that I was quickly approaching. I was thinking really fast what to do. I thought it would be weird to cross the street again, then re-cross the street to walk into the parking garage just a few steps away. Thought it would be REALLY creepy if I slowed down or stopped for them. 

I decided that I hadn't done anything wrong, we all left the same show, I'm wearing the band's shirt, and my car was like 20 feet away. So I decided to just keep walking toward my car. It looked like they might just jump right in the car and nearly be driving off before I walk by. Nope. They sit in the car with both front doors open. Again I thought that if I change what I'm doing now it would look weird, so I just keep walking. 

The girl in the passenger seat clearly didn't see or hear me walking up, and got out to get something out of the back seat. The driver saw me and like warned her friend about me, and the friend got started as she jumped out right as I walked by. I think for a second I felt like saying sorry, but I was like sorry for what? Walking? Nothing really came of it. I got to my car and drove off, but has stuck with and bugged me."

I was called to discuss it with the owner and I burst into tears from all the heightened emotions. He told me I needed to harden up and man up before I left the office or else the guys would lose all respect for me. I resigned about two weeks later. Women are able to openly cry but not men and that's poison to our mental wellbeing.

I suppose toxic masculinity is the umbrella term that would have crying under it, and it's a true problem too. As a softer geeky guy, I know women ultimately don't mind a vulnerable man, but it's hard to describe the shame feeling that can come alongside crying as a guy."

A friend of mine pointed out I was losing my hair around 20 but making a meant to be harmless joke. His Dad also made a comment about how you don’t want to go bald now.

You start to look at every mans hairline and going bald in your 20s can feel brutal.
I’m pretty confident in myself but lately each time I see myself in the mirror I feel a slight drop off in myself.

People say to just shave and other say get on the medication to stop it.

FaZe_PlatypusMan,h3rpt5m,2,"Body positivity. If you read any of the psychology literature, you'll see that cases of body dysmorphia focusing on penis size tend to involve men with normal sized penises who believe they are small. When given information that shows they are average, it doesn't help. When informed about how healthy relationships work, and about what most women (according to studies) want, it does not help. There are no known methods to treat some people who believe they have a small penis, they referred to as ""inconsolable."" These are men with normal penises. This is thanks to the insane societal pressures around penis size.

Of course, these are maybe more extreme examples, but I think you get the point. In the same way that there are movements to help women feel unashamed of their breasts, their vulva, or their weight, there should be societal pressure to push back against body shaming of men, because it is very much just as harmful, and far, far more taboo and shameful to discuss.

I began to question their motives. I eventually began to distance myself because I got creeped out. Now, I think these men were probably so lonely and shattered and had so few people to share this deep pain with and I probably seemed like someone who would ""get it.""

//

I am a 22 year old guy, I'm fat and I think that I'm ugly. This has made me absolutely terrified of approaching women my age for literally any reason other than work.  
Whenever I try to figure out what anyone would think about me when they see me, I always imagine them scared and disgusted because of how I look. It's as if anyone that I face might think I'm some creepy goblin that's out here to do unspeakable things to them. It feels to me that if I'll ever try talking to a stranger woman, she'll immediately call the police on me because I'm sexually harassing her by simply existing next to her.

I'm ugly, and I'm horrible for being ugly because I won't do anything about it.

The obvious solution would be to go to the gym, to work all this fat and depressive attitude out, but I just can't bring myself to stick to anything for a long period because I'm facing everything myself. I tried going to the gym a few times several years ago, but once things got a little less comfortable with that I just slowly move away from trying, it's not like I don't want to, but slowly I feel like it less.  
I've tried going on walks to try to better myself but my mother, bless her soul, wants me to do more, and do it faster while raising the bar each day to get this done faster and better. While I appreciate her pushing me, this always feels like too much and I eventually stop that too when it gets even a little difficult to go on walks, because then whatever I do wouldn't be enough.  
It just feels like I'm never doing enough, and that all of my problems are there because somehow I just expect everything to magically get better, at least that's what I'm told, and it feels terrible.

I just feel lonely, and I can't do anything when I'm alone.

I've always been a lonely person, even though I've had a lot of friends. It's just that after finishing high school and my military service, I've found myself only speaking to one friend, the one I consider my best friend for all my life up until now, and even then it's through texting about shows or stories we like. I know that he'll be supportive if I ever try to bring something up to him, but I don't think I'm comfortable enough to do that. It was really hard for me to realize this. Now I'm just lost, I don't think anyone from high school would be okay with me contacting them several years later. They have their own lives, I'll just be in the way. I don't want to push myself on anyone because I know that my timid nature will just force them to cater towards me when they usually wouldn't, and I don't want that for anyone. Nobody should be bothered and uncomfortable for my sake when I'm hanging out with them, so I just don't even try.

Watching shows about groups of friends make me cry because I wish I had that, and seeing anything romantic in media makes me sad because I'll never have that.

Society, and the media make me feel like I've missed out on forming a meaningful, loving connection with someone because I couldn't get a girlfriend in high school. I had female friends but who would ever want to be with a monster like me? I'm me, after all, and I don't deserve anything better than a greeting in the hallway. It's not like I think a girlfriend is just some prize to aim for in a competition, all I want is someone who isn't my mother to hug me, and smile at me, and talk to me softly in bed. I just can't help but immediately set boundries for myself with every female I see on the street: I can't look at her if she's looking at me, I can't look at her if she's walking in front of me, and if she looks back at me I've harassed her and must get away before she gets more uncomfortable. I don't want to intrude on anyone, and I don't want to be arrested for trying, so I just don't try. This is without mentioning how I don't even know where and how to start. I'm terrible with conversations, and even then where would I find someone to talk to? And wouldn't she not want to be bothered by some ugly bastard tripping over himself, making himself look like an embarassment trying to give out some compliment that she'd throw up over later? Of course not, so why even bother.

I want to be close to someone, but it genuinely feels like a herculian task that I can't do alone, but because I'm lonely it feels like I'm stuck in a place that sits just outside of reality, bound to feel sad about things that wouldn't matter in other people's eyes.

I still remember the one compliment a girl gave me on a train 2-3 years ago, and it makes me sad that I've never had anything like that afterwards.

But there are a lot of other angles coming from women, leaders, certain prominent groups, etc.  Many of today’s men find themselves in this awkward situation where traditional masculine qualities such as strength, assertiveness, stoicism, etc., stuff they were raised to idealize, are now viewed as somehow pernicious or unfair or wrong.  Men are made to feel guilty for having these qualities.  

This manifests itself in all kinds of different ways that it would be impossible to get into in a Reddit post and it’d be so long nobody would read it. But think of this - is it really any surprise that men ran the world for thousands of years?  Those masculine qualities are EXTREMELY valuable in a position of leadership.

I’m probably just lucky or maybe I ignore people glaring because all I do is stare at my kids and make sure they don’t swing on each other. Regardless I am just happy people are watching at parks/playgrounds/ etc. and not just zoning out. I would probably be upset if someone questioned me about my own kids but at the end of the day I’d just be grateful people feel like they can be assholes if a child is at risk. I would hate for something to happen to my kids and someone not do something because they simply felt awkward. I understand the grief and pain by those who have been questioned about the legitimacy of their guardianship but at the end of the day as long as my kids are with me, and safe I wouldn’t give a shit.

Edit: I don’t know how to correctly post on this GD app and I meant for this to go under one of the post talking about being questioned about their kids when out and about."

I'm not a football fan? I don't have a favourite team? Unmanly!!!

It lowkey made me happy when a girl was asking for my number but I had to deny it because I have a gf. Unless ur really hot, those compliments arent ganna come to u as often.

Harassment towards men and Gender bias/double standards. I understand while some ppl might not believe women rape accusations their even less likely to believe it from a man. Many ppl don't hold up to the double standards for men and women. While one thing might be acceptable for women is taboo for a man. While ppl Probly will ignore a man getting harassed by a women they will jump to the opportunity if a women was getting harassed.

Body image. The body positivity movement is a movement for people to feel accepted in their own body. But sadly its heavily promoted to women body positivity, I don't see much male body positivity. While looking for chicken leg tight socks (their funny af and I wanna wear them while working out my legs) I would see plus size section with a plus size women model but no one to model the men but a fit six pack man. We men also feel insecurity about our image even tho the stereotype is that we don't care how we look. While for some that me true to an extent, we also struggle with body image is why we go to the gym.

And final the underlying problem that not many ppl will care for men issues besides other men and some women. The media promotes women's rights (as they should) but neglect to shine light to men issues. We might not face as many problems compared to the women's issues, they're still issues regardless of quantity."

risusEXmachina,h3rxaw2,2,"Wow this thread is depressing, but after scrolling down to the low triple digits, ones that seem to be missed are:

-Gaining custody. There’s a lot of posts that relate to the difficulty of being a single father, even in roundabout ways, but when it comes to “womanly duties” (more so than men aren’t expected to be capable or are incredulous because women are supposed better parents) unreasonable assumptions are made and there’s a lack of investigation into both parents to give custody of the child. I’ve grown up with and dated a few people who got efed over because of the stigma and either went into foster care even though their father was capable or stayed with their mentally ill mother from ages 4-9 with a few institutionalizations in that span. And those things scar mentally.

-body shaming. This one has been mentioned, but nobody has talked about how the simplest part which is penises are seen as revolting in a majority of the world, by men and women. There was a thread a while back talking about a trans woman (mtf specifically if I’m getting terminology wrong) going into a Korean(?) style nude sauna and, ignoring the politics around that, a lot of comments were about how wrong it was to subject kids in the nude sauna to a penis when no matter which side that would happen and how no matter what you’re subjecting kids to a strangers genitals. The fact that it’s a penis shouldn’t be more or less revolting than other genitalia. Having one shouldn’t warrant automatic disgust.

-And for an even more controversial one, blue balls and testicular pain. The first can lead to varicocele which is where the blood doesn’t drain properly from the penis and can clot, lead to impotency, and hinder testicular growth. Another symptom is excruciating pain that can also be a result of cancer, testicular twisting which cuts of circulation and (as anybody who the difference between a bull and a steer can tell you) can castrate you if not treated, and bruising which is also debilitating.

Edit: Oh and two bonus ones are compliments (to/from men and women) and clothing selections. It’s hard to compliment others because of uncertain reactions, and harder to be complimented because of the same reason dudes don’t have support groups. Then there’s very few options for clothing. In order it’s basically color, material type, sleeve length, thickness, same variety for pants and then shorts, layering options, and then accessories. On the surface there’s nothing for body types, just cloths with holes in bigger/smaller sizes

Tl;dr

My doctor told me it happens to 50% of guys over the age of 50.  Till it happened to me I didn't even know it was a thing.  Everyone's heard of prostate cancer but enlarged prostate?  Nah.

The issue is difficulty peeing.  When I first started having problems, not major, the doctor put me on doxazosin, which helped.  But it can also have side effects, such as swelling of the feet.  I didn't have any side effects, not at first.  But during lockdown my feet started to swell, probably from sitting a lot and lack of exercise.  So I decided to stop the doxazosin for a bit to see if that helped.

By this time I'd been on doxazosin for several years and I didn't realise it was masking a serious deterioration in my ability to pee.  Sounds funny but it wasn't.  Excruciating pain, feeling like your bladder is going to burst, but unable to squeeze more than a few drops out, no matter how hard you try.  Straining and straining like you've been constipated for a week, every time you want to pee, ending up sweating from the effort and weak from the pain.

Needless to say I only stayed off doxazosin for a few days.  I couldn't bear it any longer. I'm a pretty positive and even-tempered guy but if I had to put up with that sort of pain and difficulty for the next 30-odd years I'd be starting to consider topping myself.  Thank God for modern medicine to alleviate most of the discomfort.

Like why target it to women and not me. I want silky smooth skin and banging eyelashes.

Also, I think men’s fashion kinda sucks. Suits are cool and all, but that’s kinda it for men’s fashion. Like you can have different colors and what not, but it’s just a suit. Women get long dresses, short dresses, revealing dresses, poofy dresses, sparkly dresses colorful dresses, and suits. Like they can have our fashion and a cup of tea, but we can’t have theirs, wtf.

Men’s underwear is, honestly, pretty decent. My asscheeks are covered by some nice Calvin Klein Shit. I think it looks and feels nice. However, it took me a while to find this good shit. Before this, I had some adidas underwear. It LOOKED fine, but it was utter shite. The reason that it was so uncomfortable as because of the crotch area. The material around there was thicker. Which made it feel rough. Combine that with the fact that there was no room for my man meat and the fact that there was a FUCKING SEAM on the inside of the crotch, right SMACK DAN in the middle, FUCKING HELL. it felt like my MOTHERFUCKING WIENER was being CUT whenever I moved. The pain became bearable two FUCKING weeks in, after wearing the crotch out a bit and getting used to it. 

I’m going to be honest, I have worn women’s underwear before. From MY experience, the material is fan-FUCKING-tactic. I put that shit on and it felt as if god himself was touching my butt. That my ass, dick, and family jewels were being supported and protected by angels with soft hands and gentle voices, whispering sweet nothings into my ear. I felt POWERFUL, I felt SECURE, I felt GOD, and he was fondling my asscheeks. Also, my dick and balls felt comfortable, which made me happy and FUCKING PISSED that the MENS underwear that I had bought can’t handle my fucking DICK AND BALLS properly, but the women’s underwear that is designed for people WHO DONT FUCKING HAVE PENISES feels great (and gives the jewels more space). 

Also, if your interested, I have learned that there is women’s underwear for people with penises. I looked it up some time ago and it came up on Amazon. From what I understand, it is targeted to trans women. I don’t have links or anything, because i saw it a while ago, but it does exist, and I think that’s pretty cool. 

Also, I understand women also face issues with some of the stuff I mentioned. For instance, there is a lot of super complex, unwritten fashion rules that they have to follow that determines what they have to wear and even the color they wear. Furthermore, a lot of things are expensive and expected of women, like getting their hair and nails done regularly. Beyond that, there are SOOO many things that I don’t understand.

jabhiram,h3s22rs,2,"Being defined by only the thing you do. My father has been working as a teacher for more than 25 years, and that is all he is always referred to as. He is never addressed as a person, which is why he developed a crippling fear of retirement. He is afraid what he will be, if he doesn't teach anymore. He is afraid how his social life is going to be, if he will even have it. Currently all his social life is intertwined with work friends. He is afraid that his children aren't really interested in talking to him. I feel bad, because I too contributed to the last reason. Recently I started talking to him alone, and he tells me countless stories from his early life that I never knew. I know he would never read this, so here it is. I love you Dad. I will always love you!"
BlaccSage,h3s2i5l,2,"No one cares about us unless we can provide something. There are countless shelters for women snd children. Countless programs to help women get on their feet. But if you’re a man? Oh you need to figure it out. How can you call yourself a man after putting yourself in this position?

Also abortion. It’s not as black and white as “My body, my choice” when you actively involved two other people. (The man and the baby). Even if you give the man the option to walk away, it still does something to you mentally knowing you have offspring roaming the earth. But if she wants it then the man can do nothing about it. But when she doesn’t want it and the man does, he can’t do anything but beg and plead for her to not kill his child. I’m all for giving women control and I’m standing by  pro choice ten toes down, but that’s not right."
Nekolover31,h3s2x5f,2,"My father raised two children (myself included) with less than minimum wage, while taking care of his drunk father (suffering from his other son's death, meaning my father's brother, and from her wife's death, meaning my father's mother). My mom was never here to raise us and almost never helped financially. She went to another country with plenty of other men.

When my father complained to the police that she never sent any child support as she was told by law; they laughed at his face telling him that they could do nothing as long as she's in another country. And then he said rhetorically that if he had been the one not paying to the mother and running off to another country, what would've happened then? The police officers have become serious and said: ""we would've arrested you for your crime"".

Not to mention that if my mother had not refused to take care of us and showed just 1% of interest, my father would not have won the trial and we would've been taken away from him. Where's fairness in that?

My father had to fight so much because of this society and I respect him for that. Raising two children, taking care of a drunk father, living through your brother's and mother's deaths, soon after his father also died, having found another woman that has also cheated on him and wanted to steal his children by beating herself in the mirror and calling the police on him telling them that he did it, breaking up with her as well leaving him much poorer than he was, working nonstop on less than minimum wage, giving his children higher education and risking it all just for them....
Everything was unfair to him and I'd talk hours about that. But it would make no difference whatsoever to my argument. Being a single father is dreadful.. while being a single mother is often seen as strong and empowering.

Every time he tried to leave her, she told him that she would sic the cops on him and say that HE was the abusive one. Because he was bigger than her, and a male, it was likely the cops would believe her over him.  


He did leave her once, and the cops came after him. The man was covered in bruises and scratched by his girlfriend, and she didn't even have a mark on herself. but the cops still believed her over him, and he sat in jail for a while. Eventually the truth came out about what she did, and while she did get into SOME trouble over it, she didn't get in as much trouble as a man would.

When the kids are upset or sick or whatever, obviously they get our undivided attention...when my wife is too tired, too stressed, needs a second to think, doesn't feel well, or just needs a break because ""it's all too much"" then it's okay and I step in, stay calm, take the kids out to play to give her her space or let her go lay down...or put my arm around her to tell her it's okay.

I don't want this to sound like a ""but what about men?!"" kind of thing coming from a young white male, but there is an immense pressure to be ripped, fit and healthy, fashionable and well-groomed, and then confident and with enough cash too.

Narrow-minded, false and stupid judgements around being the main parent or the parent who takes the most parental leave. 

Where I am (Germany) many men don't take near enough parental leave, even though the system is there to do it. That's largely down to men themselves needing to step up, but at the same time I do understand why they won't when they're faced with attitudes such as:

1. ""But you're the higher earner. Why would you take leave?""
2. ""Ah, so you're taking a few months vacation.""
3. ""What use will you actually be, especially in the early months?""
4. ""Is there something you don't like about your job?""

And so on. 

I've taken around 10 months leave, as has my wife, and my employer immediately made me feel bad about it - as if they just didn't expect a man to give a shit and do it. I've been excluded from promotion rounds, effectively replaced at my job, and been deprioritised in my team. 

I know this happens to women all the time - and that's absolutely wrong - but I guess it surprised me a little. 

If we want to be a fairer, more equal, more accepting society then we need to stop these unhealthy judgements, end of. It's not beneficial to anyone.

Did you know it is more likely for a female to kidnap a child than a man? Why do you think this is? It's because not only do people not see women as a threat so they are more likely to get away with it. It's that in society children are actively told that if they are lost or cant find their parents to ask a woman I'm fucking 15 and I was told this 😂 not to mention the man in the white van giving you ""candy"" joke.

Mental health: as someone who has worked as a cna with men who fought in wars ranging from ww2 to the Vietnam War I've witnessed plenty of them have mental breakdowns and full-on flashbacks. For most of them the age old mantra of ""be a man"" keeps them from seeking the help they need. Most of them just need someone to talk and be able vent.

Physical health: majority of men don't seek medical care, chalk it up to that age old mantra again. To top things off there are no specialized doctors who treat men, just a urologist who deals with a wide range of issues with the urinary tract. 

Clothing department: go to any clothing department store, walk through the women's section and then the mens, notice anything? Mens clothing section is limited and a third the size of the women's clothing department. With fewer choices in style and size most men are not picking clothing that fits properly, which affects their self image and can impact their career and social situation. 

This is just a small list of general issues men face and doesn't represent the entirety of issues men will face in their lifetime."
paul_zap,h3zlunu,2,"People assuming bad things in otherwise normal scenarios.

A few years ago I was at a bar in another city with some teammates (part of male teams and female teams), celebrating the end of a competition. One of the girls is deaf, and she'd had a few drinks, to the point where she accidentally stumbled and bumped into some people. She got kicked out of the bar out onto their patio and she went walking down the sidewalk about 20 feet away from the entrance, crying. I wasn't drinking (DD) and I saw the whole thing unfold, so I immediately went after her to help her because she's a good (platonic) friend and I wanted to make sure she was safe.

When I got to her she was sitting on the curb, so I sat next to her and tried understanding what happened. I had barely sat down for 5 seconds before some random guy came towards us and asked her if she knew me, as if I was someone trying to take advantage of her. In order to get him to go away, I had to explain to him all these details about how I knew her, including that she's deaf.

Even to this day, it still strikes me as one of the most hurtful experiences, to have someone assume that I was a would-be rapist trying to take advantage of a drunk woman. (I'm even gay for crying out loud!)

Another more recent example: a few weeks ago I was driving back home and stopped to get the mail, but as I was rolling up there was some teenage girl walking toward the community mailbox who kept staring back and me as I waited in my car (didn't want to get out due to covid). I'm 25. It gave me the impression that she must have feared that I was some creep, and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable just for waiting for her to get her mail so I could go get mine.

Finally, in general, say I'm walking on the sidewalk some distance (~20 feet) behind a woman, I'm always conscious that she'll think I'm some attacker (and I've actually noticed some women staring back at me), so I always try to modify my walking speed and behavior so that I can give off a non-verbal signal that I'm no threat.

These kinds of things make me feel like I need to be extra careful with how I act, because women often seem to have their guard up. And I get it, it's because they don't know who some random male is and they're trying to be safe. But at the same time, it makes me feel like shit when I've done absolutely nothing wrong."

Male victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and rape aren't taken very seriously, and even cases of female teachers sexually abusing students have been treated less seriously than the same situation with the sexes swapped.

During sex your expected to know what your doing and expected to have an amazing dick, even though we don’t choose what kind of dick we have. 

Basically if anything is wrong with your appearance, then it’s open game for women to openly make fun of you for it, however if you even say 1 thing slightly bad to a women, then it’s seen as sexist and your immediately seen as someone who hates women.

Hell if you want to talk about statistics of who is more hated, men take the cake by far. Men are statistically the most gender by a large margin. 

The only reason women are seen as oppressed in today’s media is because of sexism in the past, and the wage gap which while technically true, the wage gap is not done by companies, but actually females statistically tend to ask for less money then men, and since all companies ask how much you would like to be paid, so they can pay you less then they should, women end up getting paid less just due to genetics ig, my guess is that women are in general more caring and charismatic and that makes them ask for less without realizing it?

Most of the time we only hear about mens issues as a tool to shut down discussion of women's issues, and rarely with a good faith intent to actually address them.

Within less than 15 min I was permanently banned from the sub.

I reached out to the mods asking why and they gave me a long winded response about how I don't understand feminism.

But my comment was upvoted and given an award. All my comments on that thread were. I merely gave my honest and genuine critique of modern feminism and why they are struggling to find male allies.

Then, strangely, all at once, a lot of downvotes and negative comments started pouring in. Almost as if the mod that banned me then went on twoxchromosomes (I don't dare link their sub again for fear of being banned from here too) and got them to brigade the comment thread.

Which kinda proves my point exactly.

Some feminists on reddit are toxic and hurtful to men for no reason other than that they are men. That's sexist. And it has detrimental effects on men's mental health.

If women are hurt by ""unrealistic beauty standards"" perpetuated by other women on the internet, then I would argue men are hurt when women say (and this is a direct quote from a #1 post on twoxchromosomes 3 days ago), ""I can't help but think about the universal belief that all men are like that"" and it gets upvoted to #4 on r/all.

Feminists on reddit literally generalizing and vilify all men every single day and it goes straight to the top.

6. To be 1/3 as likely to face jail time for the same crime, like women are.

9. To have my claims of domestic abuse taken as seriously as women's are. 40% of domestic violence is female to male and men have no legal recourse against it. If we defend ourselves, we will be charged with domestic violence. 
10. Domestic violence shelters for men. Women can be just as dangerous as men. Anyone can pull a trigger. 
11. To have 50/50 custody rights be the default legal position instead of women getting full custody of the children 85% of the time in divorce cases. 
12. To have alimony and excessive ""child support"" payments eliminated.  It doesn't take $3000/month to raise a child. Many ""child support"" orders are just alimony under a different name. This is a form of slavery. It is coerced labor.

Any suggestion of trying to start a support group or shelter for men is shouted down as ""impossible"" because ""Erin Pizzey once tried to start a men's shelter, and the feminists killed her dog because of it!"" 

The men's group at my university started an awesome men's support group on campus, but if you take a look at the comments on MRA/MGTOW subs you'd think the support group founders had had to endure public flagellation to do so, when in reality the community happily backed them (particularly the coalition of women's groups).

So many amazing and compassionate ideas and solutions shouted down in men's forums because of a small contingent of apathetic folks who don't really want to see progress made, since their very legitimate grievances and their anger at the people they see as responsible have become a huge part of their identity.

It shouldn't be used as a punishment, either. Exercise should be seen as fun.

Men get consistently worse grades than women, and women get into higher education at a much higher rate than men.

Young boys like play fighting. Let them. I understand that women might not understand the difference between play fighting and real fighting, but men do. Boys are setting up a hierarchy, and a respect system. It's like how women say to us ""I thought you hated each other, you beat the hell out of each other"". The fight got out the frustrations and we spoke after. It's what men do.

Worth mentioning, not all, but most men.

Men suffer from negative emotions, but we don't talk about them. We need to burn off those emotions. Fight Club resonated because it's true. Talking doesn't help with emotions for me as much as getting down to the gym and just slugging a sack of sand. Resolving an issue is the best solution, obviously, but if it can't be fixed by the man, he might need to burn off his stress more than talk about it. Men's groups should have a place to train.

Tsundere-Neen,h3rgwes,2,"Where to start with this question. Here’s a few:

1. Men suffering from domestic violence isn’t taken nearly as seriously as it is for women.
2. Men aren’t taken as seriously when it comes to being sexually assaulted and are far less likely to report it due to instances of victim blaming or being told they can’t be victims and they must have wanted it. 
3. Men are treated as babysitters vs actual parents. Men can be parents too.
4. Men aren’t taken as seriously on issues of mental health.
5. Men are expected to be breadwinners and are put down if their SO makes more than them. 
6. Back to whole men are babysitters, they are expected again to be breadwinners and are made fun of/ridiculed if they decide to be stay at home parents. 
7. Men are expected to remain stoic or not display any emotions, if they do again they are ridiculed and made fun of. 
8. Men are expected to put their SO before anyone else but when they do they get called pussy whipped, whipped, coward or get told that their SO has their balls. 
9. When men do put their SO before everyone else and their SO becomes controlling or doesn’t let them “hang with their friends” or do anything it’s viewed as a normal part of life vs having a controlling potentially abusive partner. 
10. Men are expected to be protectors and this often leads to situations where they can be seriously hurt or killed over bullshit. 
11. Back to the whole domestic violence thing, a woman hitting a man is viewed less severely because according to society women are weaker then men and men should just walk away or take it. This creates an image of weakness in people’s minds so men don’t speak out for fear of being victim blamed or not being taken seriously."
DeedsNotLessValiant,h3rk4qc,2,"This is going to sound gratuitous… but I feel like men’s sex needs have been incredibly stigmatized, mocked, ignored, and even weaponized for generations.

Men asking for more sex (or less sex) or different sex is a topic of ridicule in almost every facet of culture. It’s a big joke. Men’s sexual needs are ignored and mocked because of myopic ideas like: “That’s all men care about.” “Men only want one thing.” “Men are obsessed” etc. 

I’m truly starting to wonder if the issue is less that men are obsessed and more that they are simply starved. Maybe we are obsessed because our bodies know we aren’t having enough sex (granted, calorie surpluses and low exercise contribute to testosterone increases, but that can’t be the whole story).

I see these mind blowing statistics about the low amount of sex people are having, and I have to wonder if part of it is due to how women (and a lot of men) overlook men’s sex needs. If TikTok and Tindr are any indication, even the women are suffering because of how much we try to bury it.

Bruh_17,h3rmbzx,2,"Low testosterone. Testosterone levels are on the decline in young very recently because of environmental factors, look up phthalates, they are a type of plastic that acts as an estrogen and disrupts the endocrine system in men.

Additionally testosterone and any idea of normal masculinity (being assertive, wanting work out and look muscular, wanting to have normal or optimal testosterone) is often being associated as toxic masculinity. Testosterone is literally an illegal drug (schedule III according to the US CSA), in a worse category than benzodiazepines(xanax et al) and even some opiates like certain forms of codeine. This means that according to the govt, testosterone has a moderate potential for addiction and physical harm, and that it poses more of a danger to society than something like codeine or Xanax when it’s on the streets. Additionally many general practice doctors are completely clueless and say that men’s levels are normal when they are definitely not, sometimes even below the threshold the IOC set as the maximum amount of testosterone a trans woman can have to compete) because the labs put the lower bound range extremely low, close to something that a super athletic female could have naturally.

Additionally SSRI’s (antidepressants) have become the new craze or trend in the health care industry because the most important this to consider since the opiate epidemic is addiction risk and since they are new and have patents, whatever so big pharma makes money off of them. 

so if you come in with symptoms of low T, your more than often going to get sent home with SSRI’s (which will make the problem worse and lower your T levels further). If youre not assertive and ask them specifically to check your testosterone. SSRI’s are a bunch of nasty drugs and despite being called “safe and non addictive” they will always get you physically dependent upon them and tapering off them has been off been described as hell, and you have like a 10% chance that the sexual dysfunction you get on while on SSRI’s will stay even after you discontinue the meds. 

Your doctor will not bring up any of these when they hand you antidepressants but the minute you mention anything that is controlled or actually works, like testosterone and testosterone replacement therapy, they will recite all the side effects,warnings, and reasons why it is bad."

I am personally above average, apparently by a decent amount, but I just recently found that out, and spent the first 29 years of my life so anxious that I was too small, that I missed a lot of opportunities.  I've genuinely contemplated suicide multiple times partly due to penis anxiety, and I know I'm not alone.

I think there are a lot of issues that cause this: toxic masculinity, porn warping expectations, and honestly a little bit of self-absorption/jealousy.

AssassinNMP5,h3tg6g0,2,"From what I’ve seen, boys who never grow up.  I am 20, and I am a supervisor where I work.  I pay my rent, insurance, electricity, internet, etc.  in my opinion, if you are an adult man and aren’t in school, you should be self sufficient (I get that everyone has a unique situation, so please don’t feel like I’m saying if you don’t do these things that I automatically think less of you).  I used to have a roommate, and we had this friend who we used to have over named Charlie.  See, up until I got promoted, I used to work nights.  So I’d sleep during the day.  Every time Charlie came over, he would treat the place like he owned it and woke me up all the time by being too loud.  He has been unemployed for a very long time and lives with his mom.  He never understood that I have a full time job and a girlfriend, so obviously it’s going to be difficult to hang out all the time.  I would do my best, but he always told me that I never hang out and it obviously upset him.  Eventually, I had to tell him that I was completely done with him, after my grandfather died and he never once told me “sorry for your loss” or anything along those lines.  Even though I helped him through multiple times where he was depressed over NOTHING.  (He’s also a racist piece of shit who’s always got something to say, basically Charlie was a 14 year old edge lord in a grown mans body).

Then, back in March, my roommate (25) came to me and told me he had to move back home because he wants to go back to school.  I asked when he was thinking about, and he told me “probably this week”.  If you know anything about renting, this is completely unacceptable.  You need AT THE BARE MINIMUM 30 days notice.  I explained this to him, and he said he understood.  2 DAYS LATER he and his dad came over and moved all of his shit out, with absolutely no heads up.  I had to drag him down to the landlords office to put his 30 days in.  I have hardly talked to him since he moved because of this.  It really pisses me off than I am 5 years younger than him and have to be the adult.

So getting back to the original point, the problem I see in many boys over the age of 18 is that they don’t know how to act like men.  Men take care of themselves, they don’t berate others for having things they chose not to work for, and they leave thing better than the way they found it.  

Tldr: men who can’t act like adults."
godonlyknows1101,h3tmdb6,2,"Poorly defined gender roles for men.

Women had the women's rights revolution of the 40's through to the 70's and beyond, that really helped to solidify their ability to be independent of men. Their roles as women really changed - and most definitely for the better! They made great gains in society in terms of equality and the new and changing role of what it means to ""be a woman"" was taught to young girls for years - even if it wasnt spoken of in those words ""be a woman.""

On the other hand, men didnt experience such a revolution of role. We were the top dog in society, we were in charge. And being ""manly"" meant realizing that fact and rising to it. And anything that wasnt sufficiently leader-like or lacking in ""killer instinct"" was seen as not sufficiently ""manly."" Being a man meant making money, being ""the bread winner"" and dealing out punishment to your children (often in the form of hitting, either with your hand or with an object).But as the roles of women changed (again, obviously for the better) they decided for themselves what their new roles would look like... Men didnt. The roles of men tried to remain the same, which I'm sure was and is the source of much of the opposition to ""women's liberation."" But in the changing landscape of our society, what exactly was the role of a man eventually became very much open for discussion. But it was a discussion with precious few answers for a very long time. While women were busy writing their own narrative, men were largely trying to pretend things were either the same as they always were, or just hoping that they'd go back to how things used to be.In short, while women's roles were evolving for the better, men were left in stagnation.

From here we see a splitting. The more traditional values of ""manhood"" took on even more hardline notions. ""Be a man"" was a term that was used more and more by this traditional group, meaning be strong, have that killer instinct, be ready to resort to violence at the drop of a hat if someone challenged your authority, and above all, have sex with women. Because real men slay that pussy (is the attitude this group often shares).The other direction male gender roles went in was very different. I suspect it was born out of support for our female counterparts. Men because supportive of their spouses and encouraged female independence. The (often derogatory) term ""Mr. Mom"" came into usage to reference men who took on the responsibilities that used to belong solely to women in society. But regardless of the scorn these men suffered, they were there for their partners.

So we had the beginnings of two different schools of thought on the issue of male gender roles. Things were, and still very much are kind of up in the air. But it's only really been in the last decade or so that we've really started to see progress being made on this issue.

In modern times, we've seen either school of thought on ""manliness"" continue to develop. On the one end of the spectrum, we have people like ""the proud boys"" who are defining masculinity as being ultra violent, extremely homophobic, emotionally stunted, and hypersexual het cis guys that get laid, get paid, and beat up anyone and anything that stands in their way. They spend their time comparing themselves to wolves and all wanna be ""alpha."" They are the very definition of toxic masculinity.

On the other end we have what I've been referring to as ""wholesome masculinity."" Which is probably not a term I was the first to make up lol. Men that dress up in tutus to play princesses with their daughter, guys that arent afraid to wear nail polish if they damn well please, or wear clothing traditionally seen as being more feminine.  The kind of guys that will hold a door open for a lady b/c that lady is a human being, not because she has boobs/identifies as a lady.  These kinds of guys are men that arent afraid to love and accept others and be nurturing. You know, the ""gay shit"" that the first group are so afraid of.

In my opinion, this second group is basically where the definition of ""masculinity"" needs to keep heading. More acceptance. More love. More vulnerability with your emotions. More supportive. We need to completely get rid of the statement ""be a man"" b/c it's so toxic and so damaging. If you have a dick and/or identify as a man, you're a man! Period! Thats all there is to it. You deserve SO MUCH better than to have that manliness questioned.The only question we need to ask ourselves, as men, is... are we a GOOD man?

P.S. Just so it is absolutely 100% clear and there is no room for confusion, trans men are men. Sorry not sorry. Everything I've said about male gender roles, I include trans men in that absolutely. Bet.

TL;DR Current gender roles for men were vague and undefined following the sexual revolution for women. Going forward, ""masculinity"" can mutate into something radical and extremely toxic, or it can evolve into something wholesome. We see the beginnings of both now. Also trans dudes are dudes."

Boys can in increasing lesser extend be boys. Meaning that they are too loud, wild, and so and so forth. People prefer quiet girls - or better feminine behavior -  in schools, daycares, etc. I've noticed the majority of teachers are female.

Also, if I understand Jordan Peterson correctly ( and please correct me if I'm wrong); men need to feel they need to apply them selves, have a feeling they have a function in society. In case that is missing, then men could develop vague physical symptoms, depression, etc.

StarCaller25,h3rbcf6,2,"Any adult male alone with a child is automatically suspect. Even when taking care of their own children many outside the situation call it babysitting. Especially women. Despite child abuse being perpetrated almost equally between the sexes and no evidence of women being better parents. 

Our suicide rate is astronomical compared to women, partially because no one gives a fuck when we have issues. We're taught to be the emotional rocks, the providers, protectors, to be tough, but unlike women we have no support structure and when we do go to people, including women they often laugh it off, tell us to man up or its not that bad BECAUSE we're men. 

Spousal abuse is done equally between the sexes. Women abuse their men every bit as much as men do their women it just gets reported less. Probably even more so because they don't SEE it as abuse. How many men have been slapped by a woman or their partner? Had shit thrown at them? Had their penis size mocked or told how they don't provide, are shit parents, bad in bed etc etc. Women don't see it as abuse and men pretend they don't care because they tend to not pay it much attention. 

Divorce is most often filed for by women and one of the most common reasons given in studies (I can't remember the source I'll try to find it.) Is that they lost their job or business or are going through mental issues. And then the divorce takes half our shit. So if we're having a hard time or are sexually unsatisfied that's our fault and a joke but if the wife is that's also our fault and a joke. 

Legal issues. Men get much harsher sentences for the same crime. It's almost impossible for the father to get custody even if they're a wonderful father. As much as 10% of all rape allegations are false potentially ruining lives and causing serious emotional, mental and relationship issues for the ACTUAL victim while the one who made false allegations faces no punishment, and that extends to custody and divorce hearings. 

Men get raped too, pretty fucking often. Sometimes by women we really aren't into and sometimes by men. But men don't report it nearly as much because when we do we're shamed. ""Why didn't didn't fight back? Well you must've liked it if you got hard. Oh please men can't be raped!"" Shit like that happens constantly especially in the military and no one gives a fuck so it doesn't get reported and if it does rarely is anything done about it.

Teacher has sex with young male and gets pregnant pinning the kid for child support? (That's actually happened btw) people applaud her or laugh it off. Teacher has sex with young girl?

I’m struggling to find a better way to say this, but most men in today’s culture are too soft, and we’ve been too quick to condem the solution of “man up.” Yes, there are problems that come with “toxic masculinity” that need to be addressed and not tolerated, but it seems we’ve gone a bit too far condemning masculinity as a whole, and turning off that biological switch for a lot of men has resulted in poor mental health and suffering.

Edit: the downvotes kind of prove my point. Society no longer views masculinity as something that can be tolerated to exist, but rather something that has to be neutered and controlled."

And many times when a 15 or 16 year old boy is raped by a teacher he gets branded as ""the lucky one"". Or better yet when men talk about sexual harassment in the work place. Personally speaking I can list 10 separate accounts where employees or myself reported sexual harassment. We where all laughed at and told we are lying because we where men.  I've also hear many people say men's feelings don't exist. And this is a major issue. Because it promotes a mindset in everyone that emotions are wrong and if you have them you arnt a real man. Which leads to insecurity and could lead to major problems such as domestic violence. People regularly in society speak on how men need to be a specific height weight build type and have a high paying job and nice home, and how if a man dosent have these items he isent worth your time. And of course. Not everyone looks for these things. But it's just as much of a problem as when women where being oversexualized. We heard constantly. That the current woman's beauty standards are impossible. Yet we ignore the men who say the standard for us is impossible. We say plus size women and refer to plus size women as thick. But its never plus size man. It's big guy. Hefty guy. Hell fluffy went around for a bit due to comedy. People need to start treating men like people.

BoneheadBib,h3qmu4s,1,"Competition. As soon as possible, it'd be great to choose who gets born, and eliminate genetic diseases, but, also, reduce the number of male:female ratio. There's no point in having more than 50% of men live pointless lives as losers, whereas there's a much lower % of female losers.

This is why it's rational to turn to crime. If top 10% (or whatever) of men get 80% of the wealth and/or pussy, then there's a huge chunk of disappointing men who get little to no wealth/pussy, and they're perfectly rational to risk death and serious injury stealing/kidnapping/raping/murdering to take a shot a not-disappointing life, wife, or net worth.

Look at China, where they skewed the male:female ratio to just 105:100, and now Chinese dudes are (rationally) kidnapping women, forcibly buying/kidnapping women from poor satellite nations, and very likely going to war 'just cuz'.

Now, imagine that the male:female ratio is something like 10:100, and everyone has good genetics and adequate prenatal/childhood nutrition and healthcare. Nearly all men are winners, and there's a similar number of male and female 'losers', and women can do what they already do, but more freely, and select rich/handsome/healthy men for partners.

Maybe I'm wrong, and this will make competition even more intense, but I sincerely doubt it. Look at cities with more women than men, NYC, San Diego, seems a lot better than the other way around, like almost all of China, Anchorage, most of South Dakota, Bakersfield, almost all of the Bay Area."

cinemint_,h3qq078,1,"One thing that is a bit demoralizing is any meaningful identity aside from performance.

Oftentimes, efforts to get women involved in a plethora of traditionally male-dominated fields has led to an interesting effect -- where the goal was to make men and women equal staples in a variety of places, it has instead seemed to cement the ""men are vanilla"" assumption in a variety of fields. If you want to matter, then you need to go above and beyond to be known for something you've accomplished.

There are special support groups, scholarships, communities, and resources for women in tech (for example). I have quite a few female friends involved in STEM (I just graduated from college) who are smart and talented and oftentimes take pride in both their femininity and tech abilities. They are all regularly praised for at least one of these two things by both school and the workforce. Perhaps consequently, the term ""man"" doesn't seem to have a definition, the sole distinguishing trait for the rest of us is any potential raw talent. If you're mediocre, then you don't matter to anyone for any reason.

While I understand why these are put in place, and I want to support everyone no matter what field of study they go into, it is a little sad that my worth inherently stems from my performance or ability to produce. This is true of everyone a little bit, but with my gender, nationality, sexual orientation, age, medical history, etc... being essentially meaningless, and without any sort of strong, alternate identity, I feel that my worth is exclusively stemming from my abilities and resources. However, many of my friends are able to rely on their inherent identity to provide some sort of orientation and support in life.

This feels like a first world problem; I don't want to come off as complaining, but it does seem to be where radicalization stems from -- everyone wants to be appreciated for who they are, and when the world at large seems to be apathetic at best and demanding of your skills and resources at worst, it does draw ire from some people.

It's an interesting problem to solve and definitely one that we're going to have to address in the next few years."

GeorgewahingtonYT,h3qxny6,1,"I was actually just thinking about this during the morning, but it’s about how we view and think about sex. Men have a basic (persistent) physiological drive for sex unlike women. A guy can do it everyday of a month, but females do it way less. Not to mention sex drive stays relatively constant for men as they age unlike women whose sex drive drives off a cliff as they age.

For women, they may enjoy sex just as much if not more, but for men it’s not even a choice but to do it. Studies show that the amount of times men take care of their needs a month is correlated with their health. And can actually be used as somewhat of a predictor for lifespan. With positive effects of masturbation/sex cutting off after 21 times a month. If you’re a guy you should know how annoying it is to be constantly urged by your body to reproduce even when you yourself probably don’t want to. If you work out, it’s probably worse for you.

That being said, regular sex and masturbation is completely healthy and  if anything, NECESSARY to living a normal life both physically and mentally. Pent up urges can cause men to get distracted easily and their mind tends to wander. And there are health benefits for both women and men, but men suffer more from the lack of sex, and benefit more from the surplus.

I’ve been thinking about it after hearing other peoples’ thoughts on the matter, and if you think about how women view sex and how men view sex, there’s a serious disconnect.

Women view it more as a casual, occasional thing and enjoy the pleasure from it, but also more of the romantic aspect.  To many, it is an activity that is reserved only for two people who truly love each other. But in reality, the only reason they’re able to think this is because they have the LUXURY to do so. Do not get me wrong, many men, including me, also view sex as a romantic activity that should be treasured between lovers, BUT for men sex is a necessity and for women IT IS NOT.

This means men cheat more NOT because they’re ass holes who don’t appreciate good women, but because once their sexual needs aren’t met they don’t operate as well, which is the nice way to put it. Sex, for men, is like a medication that we’re addicted to, aware of it, but can’t do anything about because we need it in order to live.

Asking men to not be horny is the same as asking women not to have their periods. Sorry we aren’t just a collection of thoughts and emotions, we have biological instincts and urges and things we have no control over, and it goes BOTH ways. Masturbation and sex is good hygiene.

So, when I hear men who cheat being monsters, I can’t help but think, was he starved from sex? Some individuals,  both male and female, are going to be hornier than the average, and that is just how it is, and there are also people who will have harder times controlling their urges (both ways) and that’s also just how it is. But to be frank, it’s pretty fcked up demonizing men who cheat because they were born with the bodies they were born with. It’s like calling the kid with ADHD retarded or stupid because he has trouble focusing. Relationships should include more dialogue to address this problem. This does not excuse men completely, but only asks that you look at it from both perspectives. Is the man a bad person because he’s a BAD person, or is he a bad person because he cheated? 

And to those who respond, “just masturbate” here’s my response:

There is a difference between the two, biologically, masturbation releases a rush of endorphins and feel good hormones that makes you have a good time, BUT sex  does this too, but also releases Oxytocin, which is responsible for that feel good feeling of being close with someone. It’s the same hormone responsible for a mother’s close bond with her child after giving birth and also during breastfeeding. It fosters closeness connectivity and bonding, and the craving of that feeling, in addition to the contact between two bodies, no matter how shallow the relationship, is vastly superior than masturbation. Not to mention, sex is just… better?

Especially as a couple ages and the sex suddenly drops off, it’s like going from eating at 5 restaurants to eating 7-eleven $5 pizza and wings. (gross) Men have already been spoiled and accustomed to sex, in addition to the basic biology and instincts that drives us towards physical contact rather than just Imagination and masturbation.

After a prolonged period of time, eventually, many men cheat at least once. And it’s never happened to me, but the idea itself is so excruciatingly painful and sad that it just sucks. Finding the ‘one’ and then screwing up by screwing another person you don’t even like because the little devil in your head has been telling you to have sex for 365 days a year, 1-2 a day on average at least, since adolescence, until the moment you break because your damn body and your sentient mind won’t stop opposing each other.  

society demonizes men who succumb to their urges rather than promote awareness by calling them perverts, lascivious, or monsters/assholes. Yeah, honestly it’s pretty embarrassing to bring something like that up to the person you love, depending on how your relationship is, but the reality is currently, men being shamed for being men, doesn’t stop cheating.

As it is right now, I hate the idea of cheating, but I know that in many, (not all) cases the guy who’s cheating is not a bad person, or even a bad lover. And when women respond, “what if I cheated” I don’t want to sound hypocritical, and I hate the way it sounds, and I’m still on the fence about this stance but:
 
unless your one of the abnormal few who have a heightened sex drive, then if you really love your man, you should not cheat because he did, or out of spite. But that doesn’t mean you should tolerate it completely, you should try to meet him in the middle.

I hate the idea of cheating, as I am a bit of a romantic, and I believe I have pretty good self control, but that being said, I’m still a guy, and I’m not immune from the curse of being horny and not happy, I know how it feels. And in my opinion, Women are just born blessed with the ability to view sex more ‘purely’ than men, but do not misunderstand, this does not mean we see it merely as a means for satisfying our urges, at least I don’t."

Toxic (platonic) friendships with women.

I‘m often considered what some women call a „non-gay gay friend“, which I guess is supposed to mean that I‘m a good listener? I tend to be very supportive and have developed some good platonic friendships with women. Obviously most of these are great but there have been about 3-4 friendships with women who will start to take advantage of me i.e. use me as a emotional hug-on-demand-friend if they‘re not doing well or if they need a shoulder to cry on. I don‘t mind that at all (I have a gf and she knows how I am and doesn‘t have a problem with that). When things get tough, though, and either I need their support or if I‘m not doing well, I get blamed for not adhering to their needs as a friend or even for being sensitive at all (since obviously guys aren‘t supposed to be, except if they‘re not).

Latest example was of a very close friend who I was always there for, but when I developped feelings for her best friend (the now-girlfriend mentioned above) and suffered from heartache due to different issues that came with that, I got all kinds of accusations for being a shitty friend and taking her friendship away (I knew her independently and not through her. Also I really didn‘t plan on those feelings).

aironneil,h3r6iby,1,"This is a minor issue compared to others, but in the dating world (I’m mostly talking about the straight dating world), men are expected to approach or “make the first move” so to speak. Woman aren’t. What this leads to for some is this anxiety of seeming like a creep if they try.

Women can complain about creepy men sending creepy DM’s or dick pics and most people are at least sympathetic (as they probably should). 

Meanwhile, a man could complain about being rejected or just not being able to force themselves to try and most just write it off and tell them to improve themselves, or to basically “man up” (and I also understand these responses, too). At worse, they might even be basically labeled an incel.

Not saying one is “worse” than the other. The expectation is different for both. Men are expected to learn how to handle rejection, women are expected to learn how to give out rejection (or just ignore creeps).

I support womens right to control of their body and don't think they should be forced to carry a child to term.

It however needs to also be socially and legally acceptable for a man to say they aren't ready for a child and opt out of parenthood. At this point only a few states allow this and it's a complicated mess even when they do.

If women can get an abortion without telling a man they were even pregnant then men should without shame be allowed to legally opt out of parenthood and have no social shame attached to this decision. No responsibility to raise or pay child support. 

For all of these decisions to be free of economic restraints this would require socialized Healthcare that didn't place the entire burden on women for the costs of abortion / child birth. Preferably childcare could be socialized as well to prevent single mothers from being shafted. This socialized help also benefits men because it makes the whole decision seem less like abandonment of responsibility and more a personal life choice as the woman is cared for and not forced into a poor economic situation.

For example, (not the most egregious but I've just seen it and it's in my head) I'm watching a d&d roleplay show right now and a female character just took a male character away from combat and tricked him into letting her tie him up (via magic/seduction) and then blasted him unconscious with magic.

89quietstorm,h3ulr33,1,"I say it’s the fact that we work hard, enjoy our lives and cut out the bad people as we get older! For example, I had a friend for over 20 years, one night one of my out of state friends called me and asked me what was up with my friend that lives 15 min from my house, I have know both of them for over 20 years! Anyway I was shocked because I had just talked to this friend a couple days before this night! I ask why what’s going on? The out of state friend tells me he thinks this friend is going to commit suicide and asked me if I could check on him! I was shocked, my out of state friend fills me in on what he felt was going on! Earlier in the day the out of state friend gets a call from the ex girlfriend of the friend in question. She has never called either of us and we don’t keep in touch with her! She tells out of state friend that this friend in question called her crying and telling her to say good by to his son and he hangs up on her! 

Now the time from the call she got to the time my out of state friend calls me and asks me to check on him was maybe an hour! Out of state friend called friend in question before he called me! For about 30 min he can’t get friend in question on the phone, sent a flurry of text messages and nothing! 

Calls me and tells me everything, I tell my wife what’s going on, I’m rushing to get dressed out the door I go! I tell her if she doesn’t hear from my in 15 min to call 911 and send them to that address! 

I get to his house I notice a bright red Honda sitting next to his house (a female he thought I didn’t know) I knock on the door and at first he would not let me in. I ask him if he is ok and is everything ok!  He acts like nothing is going on. I tell him his ex girlfriend called and is worried you were going to take your life! He just stares at me. I grab the door and walk into the Fram of the door and tell him, I’m coming in because I do t think he is ok. He says oh yeah ok and steps back. Right away I feel and notice someone else in the house! We walk into the living room and she is sitting in a dark part of the dining room! I keep looking and talking to him. I’m trying to figure out if the girl is who I think she is. It’s so dark all I can see is her figure and hair! I refocus on friend in question and just as I ask him a question she gets up and sneaks to the steps and goes up stairs! This is when I figure out he was faking and nothing is wrong with him other then the fact that he is faking this whole situation and a lier! I ask a few more questions, I text my wife and tell her I’ll be home in a few! 

Moral to this whole story is that a grown ass man faked this situation to get attention from that female that was hiding in his house! Needless to say we are no longer friends! I could not even look at him the same at more!  True story! What is overlooked is our willingness to be there for people who need us!"

RICEand420,h3pvls0,-29,"have you ever wondered why men can't complain about sexual frustration without being defamed? This is the just world fallacy. We treat attractiveness like a moral value when it isn’t.

The reality of modern dating can’t be the way that it is, because if it did that means manipulative asshsoles who think women are inferior are getting laid. And any self-professed nice guys who complains about having woman problems must not really be nice and must actually be a manipulative and entitles ass. Because if he were actually nice, it means that genuinely nice guys aren’t getting laid.

And any time any guy complains that he had woman problems when he tried things the normal conventional friendly, nice guy way, it’s because he’s unwashed and hideous and unrealistically expects to succeed without taking the time to look good and learn basic social skills. But if he’s not like that, then it’s because he’s only approaching super-models instead of realistic average woman. But if it’s not that, then it’s because he’s actually desperate and sending out invisible desperation signals and turning women off. But if it’s not that, it because he’s actually an entitled misogynist and is sending out invisible entitlement signals and turning women off. But if it’s not that, he’s probably raping people

And as we all know women are intuitive and can detect evil manipulative men, objectifiers, and desperate creeps, all who thinks they don’t have any external tells but thet give off a subtle signal. That’s approaching women don’t work, and creepy loser nice guys aren’t really nice – women can detect it all with their super-powers"

He also served as the Canadian Liason for the National Coalition for Men.

Sounds like a great guy, right? A genuine hero who overcame his own struggles and decided to help others with theirs.

But his story does not have a happy ending. He committed suicide on April 26th 2013 shortly after selling the shelter due to bankruptcy and ridicule.

The idea of exploring sexuality, using toys, exploring different erogenous zones or different roles is normal and supported for women, but not for men. Not only does this lead to a reduced experience available for men, but it also leads to reduced help. If you look up information on problems with orgasm, it's all for women.

sinanju1994,h3qacov,1,"Well, from what I've seen personally and heard about from others, we tend to get put in more unfavourable positions when it comes to entry level jobs than women. 

I worked in KFC about 5 years back and I'd applied to work at the front serving the customers. At the interview I got told that I'd probably be better off working the back of house cooking the food which I didn't think anything of and I took the gig. A couple months in I got talking to one of the front of house girls and she casually mentioned how she'd much prefer working the kitchen compared to the front of house and I asked her why she didn't apply for that role or ask a manager about switching. Apparently she did and got told they only put women in the front. The kitchen at the place was exclusively operated by guys. We were being expected to take the higher risk position working around all this boiling oil while the women were being paid the same as us to work the tills and put fillet burgers together. After that I started noticing it more and more in other restaurants and take-away places. Any time I could see into the kitchen while making my order it was guys working there with the women up front just taking the orders. A friend of mine who was working in a proper restaurant at the time said it was the same at his place when I asked him about that. Apparently most managers are sketchy about even letting the female employees fill boxes of chips in case they get hurt. We're positioned in more dangerous jobs in catering for the same pay. 

One of the other things that comes with that is how it affects your ability to find future employment. Most jobs have quite a heavy reliance on social skills nowadays. Working at the front in a catering job and being able to put that on a CV allows you to show that you have social skills from interacting with the customers. Working back of house doesn't allow that so it makes you a less attractive prospect for employment in other fields. Catering and retail are the big 2 types of entry level job so having one of those not only putting males at more risk but putting them in roles that leave them less likely to be employed going forward is bloody awful."

TheNinjaChicken,h3qao9c,1,"As a trans woman, I've experienced both misandry before I came out and misogyny after I came out. They are very different experiences.

My ability to express my feelings and cry were extremely stifled by being told I need to man up and not to cry. I wasn't able to talk about any of my *many* mental disorders as a result, which led to a lot of trauma as I tried to deal with this shit on my own instead of asking for help.

It also destroyed my ability to interact with people like a normal person. I'm not very masculine, so I never knew how to talk to new people because I didn't feel like I could be myself. I didn't feel like I could enjoy girly things either.

I think the big thing is that misandry is just not talked about very often. Obviously, misogyny tends to be worse, but misandry is still a really big problem, and when one happens it perpetuates the other (as well as nbphobia and transphobia)."

Boyike,h3qbbnv,1,"I have to say, probably reassurance and a sense of love. In most relationships (romantic, work related or any other type of partnership) it is expected for the man to be the one with the details, that date plans, the one that supposed to compliment and make all the first moves. Rarely ever do you see guys getting compliments or being actively reassured unless they are celebrated on an achievement in which case it feels almost fake.

A good example of this is how most guys when given a compliment will hold on to it for a long time, even basing parts of themselves just because someone complimented their sense of style, their athletic ability, their hobbies, their personality etc... Guys are emotional creatures as well, and having someone that supports them means the world to most of them."

The fact that we can't even question whether this situation has much more to do with biology than culture without being shamed or dismissed as a sexist is also very real.  Prominent female scientists agree that testosterone promotes [risk-taking](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-014-0020-2) and [status-seeking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453019312934) behavior in both men and [women](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-015-0037-1).  It makes one question all the cultural interventions society is rolling out based on the assumption that the over-representation of men in leadership is cultural problem alone, or that is is an addressable problem at all.  

I feel the need to clarify that cultural oppression between both genders is absolutely very real and manifests in different ways, but the over-representation of men in leadership may really just be more an emergent property of our biology, and not ""the patriarchy"".

It's dismissed and not believed. Even mentioning abuse towards men, a lot of people presume that it's by a another man. Even when evidenced, it's often not dealt with properly. Men's shelters are in incredibly short supply and the police attitude towards it is atrocious.

I've sit in on Domestic Abuse Awareness training at work run by an agency connected to the government and not a single male case was mentioned. This just sums up the attitude.

As a personal example, when my ex pulled a knife on me (after a number of other offenses), the police told me I'd be fine since I was bigger than her. I got a free call to a solicitor which told me nothing would be funded, while she as the perpetrator got access to tons of resources. 

It's a huge contrast to domestic abuse towards women. That's highly publicised, there's a lot more resources/funding and the public attitude is often happy to believe it with no to minimal evidence. 

Domestic Abuse towards women is a serious issue and more common, but stats show that it happens to men *a lot* more than people think."

Kato_LeAsian,h3qhega,1,"The issue of needing to “be a man”. Luckily I grew to have a very secure sense of my own masculinity - others weren’t so lucky. This causes a wide array of problems and stress men frankly put on themselves. 

For example, for my 20th birthday, a group of friends from highschool all got me a stuffed elephant (my favorite animal) with a little voicebox in it on which they recorded “Love you Kato_LeAsian”. It sits on my shelf in my room. I had some guy friends from college over one day - most of them payed no mind to my stuffed animal, but one of them was absolutely floored that I had it. I told him it was a gift from some friends, and he asked, “were they girls?” to which I responded “yea some of them.” He went on about how he would never want to be caught having a stuffed animal, and that he would never even think to buy one as a gift for another guy. So my friends get me an incredibly thoughtful, heartfelt, and adorable gift, and I’m not supposed to enjoy having it because I’m a guy and that’s supposedly not manly? This friend is a good person mind you, he just has problematic, outdated beliefs on a lot of stuff including masculinity. He was just legitimately baffled that a guy gifted another guy a stuffed animal. 

I’ve also had a few dudes try to “guilt” or “anger” me into doing something they wanted by calling me a pussy. To which I’m always like, “dude, if you’re gonna try and guilt someone into doing something by calling them a ‘fucking pussy’, then you’re gonna have to try it on someone who’s as insecure in their masculinity as you are.” I don’t actually say thay obviously - that’s what I think when I go over the argument in my head in the shower. I actually just ignore them and say something like “Ill think about it” or “whatever”."

Yet people dismiss the gendered nature of male victimisation, by stating that the perpretrators are men too, as though that does anything to help the victims, or reduce the risk of violence that men face.

People also dismiss this issue by victim-blaming, by implying, or directly stating, that male victims of violence were somehow complicit in it, as though they were looking for a fight, or out drunk and causing trouble.

Mental health, homelessness, abuse, inequality/double standards such as prison time or likelihood of arrest, even at younger ages things like cyber bullying are seen more as an issue for girls than boys.

I'm not trying to make it out like men are this poor group of people that have it really bad or anything.

But beyond medical recovery, both parents should get equal leave and society should encourage even push men to taking it so they can bind with their kids and get to know the needs of their kids and obligations they as parents gave to those kids.  I read an amazing article on this by Harvard specialist consultants who were brought in to consult on why upward mobility for women in the company was an issue.  They accommodated women, but women still lost out in opportunities.  But also, men who got no real parental leave felt pressure to move ahead professionally and felt equally frustrated, depressed, and unhappy that they couldn’t be more time to bind with their kids at birth.  So parental leave is key for both sexes! (I am a single childfree woman endorsing these views! I may not have or want kids, but I support parents!)"

It's clearly an eating disorder and it seems he wants to be stick thin. Best part? he's married with a son and is very clearly in denial with his eating disorder.   


We always hear about women with eating disorders but when men get them it's somehow ""normal"". As a result its a lot harder for men with eating disorders to even admit they have one because it's considered something only women have and many suffer in silence until their health takes a huge hit and even then, they might not admit something is wrong."

I'm no wilting violet by any stretch of the imagination- have been through some pretty sh**ty ass times and suffered mental health wise last for it. 

Luckily l I'm mentally strong as hell so I bounce back well....

But all of them. Men are expected to be strong, keep it together, support the family.... all that reverse misogyny... the moment that there is an inkling of weakness the default position is to tell yourself, or be told to ""man - up"". I've said it. Been said it to. Didn't think about it until way too late.

These days if I'm having an off day I just own it. Tell my wife who understands and leaves me to resolve myself. Or offers to help. The only difference is I'm not being told to man up. I still feel obliged to sort myself out with no help but I feel better knowing that my crap days are acceptable. 

I'm strong 95% of the time. I'm lucky enough to not be judged on one of my 5% days.

But that's my answer. 

All of the men's issues are overlooked. Sometimes people need to stop with the societal sh*t and remember that we are all human no matter what. And we aren't perfect. Sometimes we break and we need a little maintenance. TLC. Men need to have more ownership of themselves and let it out. Everyone else needs to be less judgemental. 

How about...

We are all allowed to have a bad day. We are all allowed to sit and feel sh*t about everything, and nothing all at once. Men, women, kids. All of us. It's cathartic to have a broken day. It gets it out of the system. Let's just accept that others are allowed to have a bad day. And let's just accept that we need to get off our asses once we have had a bad day, and play catch up, because life still goes on.

We are allowed. Let's not assume it's weakness. Because that is is what men are driven by.... not appearing weak."

Even when it comes to incredibly serious topics like domestic abuse and rape, WHICH DOES FUCKING HAPPEN, men just bottle it up when they need to speak out about it. This same toxic masculinity is also why there are a ton of bisexual men who don't ever come out because of the ridicule they would face from their peers. Men aren't told to talk about their feelings and to be open about them and it whittles down an individual until the only option left is the last option.

This is something that has to change because of how much of an issue it is. Everyone should be equal and treated as equal. We can solve every issue women face regarding equality but if men rape and domestic violence victims still can't come forth without facing consequences from their peers, then we haven't done everything we could to reach perfect equality. I am not gonna debate which side has it worse because it is never a contest. Both sides face inequality and as long as that exists, we need to keep working towards a better future."

Beyond all of that, society would never advance if half the population was focusd singularly on reproduction. It just gets annoying to hear all the time, especially when I have other things I am far more interested in.

As a Man, if I fail at life in some manner, I will only be looked down upon, and seen as useless for not being able to provide. There is no unconditional love for a Man. A Man must be able to provide a basic utilities for living, or they will not be loved. Women will scoff and walk away because they are sure they deserve better, children will be taken from us so that they may have a better life. I'm not complaining, I wouldn't want my children living with me if I truly couldn't provide for them. What I am saying is that it is our lot in life. If a Man is ever unsuccessful, he will lose EVERYTHING until he is successful once again. A house, a job, a wife, kids, everything will be gone if a Man falls too far down. The only thing we have a shot at keeping is our Dog. Dogs truly are Man's best friend, and will stay with us through all hardships.

Rape, by the dictionary definition, was Forced Penetration. By law, this meant that Men could never claim to have been raped. It frequently gets overlooked or diminished. Men are told that they totally enjoyed it, and that their concerns are invalid. Media reports on Women raping Men will often use less shameful terms in an attempt to downplay the act. It may not even be concious that these authors do it, but time and time again you'll see it getting downplayed.

Men are often considered to be the worst when it comes to parenting. These jokes fill our media consumption, and wives will often joke about not wanting to leave the husband alone with the kids for too long, insinuating that they'll eat junk food, not clean, and laze around all day. And when divorce hits, Men will almost always lose out when it comes to who gets the kids.

Speaking of divorce, a Man can lose everything there. A house he's worked for his whole life? Gone. All the money he's saved? Alimony checks are gonna diminish that real quick. And his own flesh and blood? Weekends, holidays, and little more. Unless he can actually prove to the biased courtroom that his Ex-wife is not mentally sound, the Man has no shot at gaining Primary or Sole custody of the kids.

A lot of this stuff is not fun to talk about. But you'll find that men just put up with it. Because that's what we do. We put up with shit because there's not another option. And if it's Toxic Masculinity to say it's weak to kill yourself over that shit, then call me a Toxic male. We're Men, and we have our Pride. We stand strong through this shit, and when we trip and fall, we pick our selves up by our God-given bootstraps, and we move forwards again. I don't know very many, hell I don't know any Men who are looking to fix this shit. We're just working through it.

But Men are smart, and we know how to avoid these pitfalls. You'll notice a decline in marraige happening around the world. Many of the problems Men face revolve around struggling to support their families, or their families ditching them. So Men are smart, and avoid these problems in the first place. If a Man wants family, he'll often find his time is well spent at a Youth Center or at a church, where he can help others grow without the risk of failing them or losing them.

Life is hard for Men, harder than most people realize. But you'll never hear us complain about it, because we have better things to do. There's a leaky pipe under the sink, and Plumbers are fucking expensive. It ain't gonna fix itself. The dryer ain't dryin shit, gotta fix that. Car Engine shut off, gotta fix that. This kinda shit is day to day for us. We've got better things to do than whine about how unfair the world is, mostly cause whining about a problem ain't never fixed it.

The amount of times i’ve been told I ‘need the calories’ or ‘how much do you weigh?…. man, my left leg weighs as much as you….!’ often by other men who are in the higher weight range or have simply horrendous diets!

I’m 27 and at the absolutely bang on healthy weight for my age and height. I look after myself and try my very best to stay at a weight that I feel happy with and also know i’m keeping my risk of weight related illness down.

Body positivity is really an issue amongst men and to be slim and in shape (but not super muscular) is something to be sniffed at I feel nowadays. We don’t comment on men who are overweight (and rightly so! someone’s weight does not define them) but for some reason it’s perfectly acceptable to comment on how ‘skinny’ a male is.

I’ve had to work through a lot of body image issues due to being very skinny when younger…. to the point where I only feel comfortable when i’m within a certain weight range.

When it comes to parental roles fathers are valued way less than mothers, just look at how custody cases usually go.

See [Chris Avellone's current ordeal](https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/1408703025422733315) or [this man who was creep shamed on Facebook](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/05/11/creep-shamed-on-facebook-was-actually-man-taking-selfie-with-darth-vader/).

In 2019, I was falsely accused by two friends (Ms. D and Mr. S) of harassing three women (Ms. L, Ms. E, and Ms. K). I immediately lost most of my friends. If I wasn't working retail, I probably would've gone crazy from the loneliness.

I was harassed at work. People would show up just to stare me down. In the community, the room would suddenly go quiet when I walked in. I received a threatening phone call while at work from one of their colleagues. I received threatening text messages from an unknown person (it's a burner phone not registered to anyone).

There are six places near me I am not allowed to go to because they have standing orders to call the police if I am seen. Some of them are acting in good faith; they truly believe the lie that I am a predator.

I have collected evidence regarding what happened, and my lawyer told me that I would break even at best if I won, and I had a hard time proving they acted in malice. If they could even spin it as a misunderstanding, I would be out a lot of money.

Plot Twists:

1. None of the three women complained about me.
2. One of my accusers (Ms. D) told me to contact her so we could talk about what I did. Instead, she intentionally ghosted me to manufacture proof that I was a creep towards women. She outright admitted this in a phone conversation that I recorded.
3. One year later, I reconnected with Ms. K and she told me her side of the story. Apparently, Ms. D, Mr. S, and their friends told her I was obsessed with her and they feared for her safety. Around the same time, they told me that Ms. K was afraid for her safety around me.
4. Apparently, Mr. S had asked Ms. K to go camping with him. He's old enough to be his dad."

I met this guy. I didn't meet him really, my ex brought him home from the bar. He was loud, and mostly annoying... a much younger fella. And it was like 4/5 guys all drunk and high as balls howling stories at one another and laughing and he told a story, and they all laughed... Har har HAR OMG soooo funny, looool!!!

Except his story was One time he and his woman got into a fight, and he said he was leaving and she said fuck that, no you aren't and jumped in front of the door, and so he couldnt leave out the front door of his third floor apartment because she was blocking the only exit and he would have to physically lay hands on her to move her and with the two assault charges he had for that bar fight and the time he got into it with his brother in law, the cops would never believe him...

So he went out on the balcony, climbed over the edge, and figured he could Spiderman his way down. He could not. He fell and broke both his legs. 

HAAA HA HAA HAAAA!!! OMG all the men there just DIED laughing. Holy fuck, so funny!!

Massive /s, obviously, but still accurate. They laughed. Uproariously. 

And I threw in my two cents and said, ""Can I just say, as a woman, as a female, how fucking disgusted I am, that in order to escape that situation, that in order to have your ""I'm done"" heard and respected, you had to do such a thing!? That you were put in a position where your choices were to be a bad man or a literally physically broken one? That it's inexcusable and not fucking funny to me at all? I'm sorry. I'm sorry she did that to you, that you were put in that position, and that you were hurt like that. I'm sorry.""

At which point the poor kid burst into tears and I had basically killed the party atmosphere. But we (young lad and I) actually stayed up and talked most of the night, about relationships and abuse and feminism and misogyny and all that good shit. I got some good hugs outta that kid. 

And to this day, I still can't believe that having to say, ""Nah, kid, being forced to stumble on a climb off a third floor balcony to avoid just reaching behind some woman and opening the door to squeeze past her, lest she claim you grievously and maliciously injured her doing so, is fucked the fuck up.""

I was in 2nd fucking grade when a group of girls accused me and my cousin (same age) of talking about undressing some random student. Way too young to even think about that kind of shit, and all staff treated us cautiously after that. It took a whole week of constant denying before the counselor decided to bring the girls in one at a time and interrogate. Their story fell apart and one of the girls flat out confessed saying they made it up. Scarred me for life tbh I am now 30 and still worry about shit like that. Even worse, it has partially convinced me a lot of victims are lying even though I know they really could have gone through some disgusting traumatic shit. I feel so sorry for true victims especially with shitheads out there faking cases for God knows what reasons."

I have had other guys tell me only pussies eat salads or that men need meat for every meal while I was just trying to push myself to eat better and lose weight. Also, I live in the south and it is a thing here that if you're at someone's house and the woman there is cooking anything it is socially unacceptable for you to not eat it if you're a man. A woman can say she's trying to lose weight and it's fine but if a man says it he's being rude.

As far as being a stay at home dad, I haven't personally experienced it but I have heard my family talk about how lazy my cousin is because he raises the kids and his wife works. His wife owns a beauty salon and makes enough to support a family with one income. People should be proud of her. She's a woman in America and she started and successfully runs her own business and survived through a pandemic when business plummeted. Instead, all my family can think about is that my cousin raises that kids and she works. I seriously doubt anyone would bat an eye if the situation were reversed.

 You wanna know why men tend to die faster? It's this kind of shit. We are under constant pressure to be leaders and earners and to at least be making more than the woman we're with. I am definitely not saying that men have it the worst. We don't for certain. But we're all being punished in some way by the society that we live in."

Dramatic_Glow,h3qy26h,1,"Both physical/tactile affection and beauty self-care are often overlooked. Both are big causes for loneliness in men. We are not supposed to hug, kiss or caress others as an act of friendly love, instead it's often perceived as a threat or a violation of the other person's space. Lack of trust in the gender is a huge deal here. Men that have a more haptic need to fell wholesome are often seen as crossing the line, being weak or being gay. Women can engage in those actions more carelessly and is mostly perceived as cool and cute.

Same thing when it comes to self care, body love, and self beauty. The huge lack of options for men in the beauty and fashion industry is the best proof of this. It's funny when we compare to other living creatures in the natural world where the males are often the ones showing off colors and patterns. 

Lastly the main issue here is education and parenting since that's the territory where self doubt and self limitations are formed.

I see a huge social change coming in that respect, though, with people in the music and entertainment industries leading the charge and the change in awareness."

Spaced-In,h3qykqu,1,"Physical and sexual assault.  I have been raped twice (both by a man and by women), and sexually assaulted several times (groped at work behind a bar, etc).  One time, when clearing glasses from a table of middle aged women, one of them leaned over and full on grabbed and held onto my cock and balls, as in like, such a firm grip that pulling away was difficult and painful.  It took all of my willpower not to smash the glass in my hand across her face.  I told the owner about it and she said “so?  Man up!” 

When discussing these incidents to people I often feel like it’s never taken seriously and although it’s not a competition and I’m aware women experience this more often, I’ve seen men and women respond to lesser instances of sexual harassment with much more shock and horror than some of the things I’ve told these same people that happened to me.  

There have been one night stands who have asked me to do extremely dirty things to them including one woman who asked me to violate her safeword because it would be “so fucking hot” if I did that.  When I tried to explain why I’m not capable of that, I’ve had women saying some pretty unsavoury things to me about it.  

Another aspect is just straight up assault.  I grew up in an area of Scotland that had either amongst the worst or the actual worst gang violence in Europe during the 70s/80s, and when I was coming up it was still really bad.  I’ve been in countless fights and getting stabbed, glassed and even murdered wasn’t uncommon.  
One time recently, walking with my partner, two aggressive and drunken neds passed us.  One had that vibe of looking for a fight and started walking across the side of the bridge we were on  towards our side, essentially devoting more of the space to them and forcing us to squish close together and sneak by.  Based on countless fights before, the way I see it is, the fight has already started and if I cower away (what he wants) it’s a sign of weakness and he will escalate, so I had to stand my ground and initiate aggressive returned eye contact and not move out the way because if I did, the emotional part of the fight is lost and gives this person a significant morale boost to initiate actual violence.  This has happened to me several times.  Normally I wouldn’t care but my girlfriend is with me, I’m clutching her hand fearing for her safety, I can’t protect myself and her at the same time.  Luckily, I’m no stranger to a scrap and this guy seems to realise that and lets it go with a simple shoulder knock as we pass.  As soon as we turn the corner I’m on my knees shaking because of the intensity (again mostly for fear of what would have happened to her in the likely event I can’t fend off two larger men), and she was completely oblivious to the entire exchange, to her it’s so subtle but to me it was so intense.   She laughs it off as if I’m being over dramatic.  She had no idea how much danger we were in.  When I was younger and that kind of thing happened I would back down and they would see you’re afraid and take advantage and they would kick your head in."

I also found myself actively concealing this fact from all of these friends, save one old girlfriend from college who really knows me.  I told her I needed to talk, got on Zoom with her, and was literally shaking.  She could actually see it through Zoom— I was that bad.  Meanwhile, no one else suspected anything was wrong.

I also realized that the remainder of my friends didn’t really want to hear that kind of stuff anyway, and none of them really share that kind of stuff with me.  We’re all so busy keeping up this air of perfection, punctuated by comically minor mishaps, that we’ve learned to hide the truly critical stuff.

The obsession of achievement and legacy gets in the way of any personal development or positive gain for any relationship, be it plutonic or otherwise.

I know this isn’t universal, but I feel like my value to my family, at some point became centered and what I can provide, be it time, material items, or emotional support. Who I am became less important and my value no longer comes from the things they once adored.

I feel like I’m on the bottom rung some days and it’s isolating.

That being said I have an amazing wife and genuine love being a dad. It’s not a burden, but I feel like there is little to no support structure socially. I’m a big believer in diminishing toxic masculinity but have found components of it exist in relationship dynamics that only negatively impact males.

It’s just strange no one told me how lonely it is some days."

IronSlanginRed,h3r42sd,1,"The lack of family care. As a divorcee, I do not have the informal societal resources available to me to help me care for my child. Not only am I expected to work more and pay child support even at half custody, I don't have a good way to accomplish that. My kid is aging out of daycare, so what do I do after school and before I get home from work? The kids programs are few and far between. Most family's are using informal care networks. Mom's watch other moms kids while they work, and they switch days, etc. As a dad I don't have access to that. My parents help out as they can, but I have to try and work with my kid there for four days a week still. Do I cut back my hours? If I do then I go to jail for not affording child support. Do I give up custody of my child? Because that just is a sucky option. It's really a situation that has no good solutions."
TheStumpyOne,h3r43ek,1,"This isnt the case all the time, but Burnout can be much more severe for men. Having to constantly balance work and home life hits us in different ways, where there is much more initiative required by societal norms of us. There are just so many plates to keep spinning and often because of expectations and norms we dont get help with that. Even just resting relationship plates for a bit can cause feelings of insecurity in our partners and cause them to look elsewhere for that stability.  (Subconsciously of course)

Life is like a treadmill for us, especially those who have managed to get ahead compared to where we started, but not far enough ahead to have security. If we stop, we have to start over because it causes instability in relationships where we are relied upon for security.

In my personal case, I work 70 hours a week, im used to that. I have ways of navigating that to make myself not burn out, but on the 1 weekend a month I have off, I am asked to meal prep for the week for my girlfriend just because she loves my cooking more than her own. Which I get, I have had her cooking, but when I mention that I need time to relax or decompress, she continues on until I cave, in very subtle ways that if she were called on it she would play off or deny. You would think that me having to tell her I need a break every time would deter her from asking, but she does it every time without consideration. I feel fortunate that I cook well enough that I can make her happy, but at the same time I am so goddamn tired. I have tried to teach her how I cook, but she doesnt have the patience. And I cant just start cooking poorly. I feel trapped. I love her, but the cycle of continuous effort can be a bit much."

. Stories like, wheres that dude? no one knows, he got out and no one knows where he is and even if he will even go back

. Hearing stories of men of my family is always something i discover from others, and just a little bit, because they never tell and since is not questioned, people barely knows, mind that doesnt need to be a bad life stories, its literally anything.

. Men that die, are in bad health state or health state in general, takes sooooo much time to people know that they are feeling bad or even dead, cause no one goes after them to have initiave to talk or see how things are going, they also feel deeply uncouraged to tell people that, i noticed that thinking of my father, he died, sooo much people took time to notice that, so much people got to ask me cause they didnt had any contact to him for years cause he walked away from lots of people for a reason even i dont know, also ive hear the same from lots of people in lots of families and several cases like that.

Even my family was like “yeah you’re finally a real person now”. Whole time I was anorexic and I didn’t realize it. I kinda almost died, and then proceeded to yo-yo w gaining a bit and loosing a bit. Anyhoo I’m 21 now and at the best shape of my life, but that means putting so much time and effort into my body to look “normal” is something I’ve just come to accept. The attention from girls and peers is astonishing. I love it, but it all kinda just seems empty yuno. Also the extreme dieting and bullying kinda did something to my mental as right now I suffer a lot of problems, such as anxiety and depression, and when I look back to see what might have started it this is the only thing that makes sense. Also I lost the weight when I was 16, about 5 years ago. Thing is though, it all still feels like yesterday. The bullying, the extreme diets, the crazy changes, not that I’m complaining but it’s really just a big factor that shaped and changed my life.

Males were convicted of the vast majority of homicides in the United States, representing 89.5% of the total number of offenders.\[51\]  
Males were more likely to be murder victims (76.8%).  
 ""2011 arrest data from the FBI:

I’ve never had the opportunity to ask men in an environment where I don’t think they would be guarded whether they too long for a day where there is no “men’s section” and “women’s section” in retail stores. Women aren’t frowned at for walking into the men’s section and grabbing a NASA t-shirt anymore but if a dude wanted to grab some women’s trousers because they fit him better, or a floral t-shirt, or skirt it would be a big deal. 
if I chucked on some cargo pants and a flannel shirt where I’m from, at worst I’d be seen as grubby, ugly or a poser skater (problematic but I still have the option without assumptions of my sexuality). But if a guy wanted to wear some pink flares or a skirt, he’s cross dressing, he’s neuro-atypical, must be trans, he’s gay, he’s a creep, *insert-bizarre-diagnosis* etc. There are so many assumptions rather than a dude just liking a colour or an item of fabric and simply wearing it. The consensus for majority of women my age in regards to David Bowie wearing a skirt, Harry Styles wearing a gown, the Eurovision winners having a lead singer who is in a hetero relationship but expresses his love of wearing makeup and skirts/dresses and crop tops is a big YES. They’re flaunting their femininity all while being successful heartthrobs to young straight women, that being said I’m still aware they receive plenty of hate. So I just wonder where you might think the pressure is coming from the most? But regardless of your preferences and wether you’d personally partake in wearing feminine clothing would you support a future where your fellow men can do so without the bat of an eyelid ? Do you feel suffocated by the restrictions on your self expression if you’re a man that is interested in feminine clothing? Would you like the option regardless of whether you’d want to explore it?"

In reality, it's entirely valid for men to be hurt by gender dynamics too. We shouldn't shame men for struggling with the impact of narratives around their gender, or minimize the hurt that can cause.

AngusSabre,h3r7nre,1,"I fully expect this to be deleted but here goes.... This is in Australia (And I do believe men who are violent towards women need to bury under the prisons.)

In recent years, stats provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), show that female victims of domestic violence have been murdered at a rate of one per week.  
Between 2016–17 and 2017–18, the Australian Institute of Criminology’s (AIC) National Homicide Monitoring Program (NHMP) recorded 183 domestic homicide victims from 173 domestic homicide incidents (see Glossary for definitions). Data from the NHMP are from police and coronial records. Of the 183 domestic homicide victims, there were:  
•	101 victims of intimate partner homicide  
•	30 victims of filicide  
•	23 victims of parricide  
•	8 victims of siblicide  
•	21 victims of other family homicide (Bricknell 2020a; Bricknell 2020b).  
Of all domestic homicide victims, 55% (100) were female.  
  
Recently, statistics showed that men were committing suicide at a rate of nearly 7 per day! In 2018, it was a rate of 44.6 men suiciding per week. Women were also suiciding at a rate of almost 14 per week. This is 31% that of men dying from suicide.   
  
On the 20th of May this year, the Australian Mens Health Forum (AMHF – who are outspoken about the lack of action on male suicide prevention) reported that the Federal Government in this year’s budget has committed to a major investment in suicide prevention, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announcing $298 million towards suicide prevention.  
https://www.amhf.org.au/government\_budget\_overlooks\_men\_say\_suicide\_prevention\_leaders  
  
In the same budget, as reported by news.com.au, the opening paragraph is as follows:  
“After months of heated discussion about the welfare of women in Australia and several shocking cases of domestic violence making national headlines, the government has revealed a massive $1.1 billion package to combat the blight on our nation.”  
https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/federal-budget/federal-budget-2021-domestic-violence-prevention-receives-11-billion-funding-boost/news-story/7b307fd4f9118bc8124d921e67c3f32b  
  
The budget between the two show that suicide prevention has a funding of only 27% for that of Domestic Violence. Total suicides for 2018 was 3046 compared to the two year total of domestic violence homicides shown by the NHMP being 183. Halving this alone shows that it’s about 33 times more per year that someone dies by suicide than domestic homicide.  
  
Any National headlines or any reference to the blight of our nation in reference to DV is the media ignoring the facts and succumbing to pressure from groups most probably looking for political preferences."

So the Woman takes the child with her across the street and more men approach so they wander into a park. The men surround her and a cop pulls her aside and puts her in handcuffs as it is revealed she is the kidknapper. It was an Amber alert advert.

After my daughter was born I could think about nothing but directly caring for her. I felt like every single decision I was making might be the wrong one which in turn lead to me not doing much of anything. Not knowing that this was a normal thought only perpetuated the feeling that I was failing as a parent. Compounding the issue was the social concept that more then ever I needed to be focused on supporting my daughters mother, I needed to be a emotionless rock for a woman who’s own mental state made her think me saying she looked good was in fact me pointing out that she did not and only saying she did to make her feel better. ( depression is a wicked monster) The stress, depression, and anxiety tanked our lives post baby. Eventually we both recovered but between that and pervious issue our relationship was unrecoverable. I’m now a single dad with primary custody and have never been happier. While my kids mom still hold deep resentment that I wasn’t there when she needed me the most we manage to get on pretty well for our child most of the time. 

I hope that in the future more awareness on the mental states the stresses of having a child has on both genders happens. I truly think a large percentage of run away fathers are due to postpartum depression in men that are under the cultural norm that men need to be emotionless rocks and seeking help is wrong. (which is very hard thing to do as a man or a woman in regards to your child) Too many guys I know with estranged kids seriously regret the decision, but it’s a monumental action to try and walk back after it’s been made even if it was made in horrible mental state."

I completely sympathize with many of the stories. I’m a caregiver and it’s rare to have men be caregivers in my profession and when we do have male caregivers, they are not treated well by all the other women caregivers in my agency. Right now I have a male coworker (fake name) Greg, whom I’ve known for quite some time and does an amazing job for our elderly female clients. We only have female clients, so he does the very best that he can to be respectful of the client and the families. But there’s this other caregiver that does the AM shift (fake name) Heather, who gives him so much shit for doing a night shift at a location that the three of us work at. I do the PM 2-10pm, and Greg relieves me from my shift in the evening. Sometimes he gets there early so that we have time to talk and stuff and recap the day at the client’s home we work at. He tells me that when Heather relieves him of his shift, it’s always with bitterness, and our client has dementia at 97 years old, so when the client wakes up and is startled to see a man in her home, Heather is very quick to blame him for simply being a male that’s making our client agitated. But it’s not even his fault!! There are no women that can cover literally the TWO nights that he works, Sat + Sun. The client needs 24 hour care, so they gave him the position to cover, and that’s it! It really sucks to see him go under such scrutiny, especially when the other hospice women come in and agree with Heather, saying that the client’s mood is for his fault over the weekend evening times. It’s just such bull shit. I’ve told my supervisor that Greg does nothing to agitate her, and gives her the correct meds when she becomes aggressive. He does all the night shift chores that he’s supposed to do and leaves the house clean. Greg is thankful I intervened, it’s literally the only reason why he kept his job at this location, but Heather insists he should be let go. Well if she’s willing to give up her weekend nights and cover his shift, which she is definitely not, then she needs to shut her fucking mouth."

It kinda sucks that lots of people attribute so much importance to losing their virginity and if someone hasn't had sex, then they feel like they're a loser or are missing out on something amazing.  Sex can be neutral or underwhelming but that side is rarely discussed and it creates a sense of pressure in some people where they feel like they need to have sex in order to feel validated.

kindParodox,h3rb7b7,1,Simple answer... Sexual assault charges where it's a male victim and anything regarding domestic assault. Men statistically don't report these crimes as often as women and thus victims rarely if ever see any sort of justice enacted in their favor. Also it's not unheard of for a male victim to then see jail time for their victimization if the woman (or other male) perpetrator reports them as the one doing the act. As a result the criminal justice system has an unspoken but very obvious double standard in these areas.
makesyoudownvote,h3rb80r,1,"I don't know about overlooked but people tend to either overly embrace or completely dismiss the very idea of false rape accusations.

I was horribly raped, abused and tortured through my childhood, by a woman. Which meant no one took it seriously. Despite the fact that I have urinary issues from the scar tissue now in my urethra from some of the shit she did to me. Not to mention the plethora of emotional and psychological issues. I've described it in detail quite a few times on here, buy I feel like this issue is finally being addressed, it might still have a way to go, but it's moving now. 

But when I was in College, I was falsely accused of rape. To this day if I ever mention it people immediately assume that I was actually guilty and I'm just a scumbag. FUCK YOU! As someone who has been on both sides of this, I don't even think one is that much worse than the other. You have no idea how severely your life is destroyed by this. In both cases the biggest issue is not having anyone believe you. 

I was EXTREMELY lucky that she started getting carried away with the lies and her roommate eventually came to my defense with photo evidence otherwise I 100% would be in prison today.

In a nutshell it was a girl I was seeing who I didn't really see a future with. I broke up with her and she tried every trick in the book to get me to stay. I'm ashamed to admit, I did for like 2 months. I was in college, insecure and really wasn't good at saying no. She was also kinky like me (I genuinely used to not be able to get off from anything vanilla, probably as a result of my childhood trauma, but you get the point), and I was convinced that I could never find someone else like that, and she played on that. But I didn't like her as a person and I felt down, depressed and uncomfortable everytime I was with her. She was extremely manipulative and self centered.

She had been threatening to say I raped her for a while at this point, but I didn't think she was serious. But she did, I was arrested and expelled from college. She had a whole folder of ""evidence"" ready, including photos of some BDSM stuff we had done. Even when the irrefutable proof came out that proved that I couldn't have raped her in the way she described, the college still expelled me and never overturned it. It took me 10 years to finally graduate after that from a much worse school.

Now I am not saying don't believe rape claims, because I know first hand how bad that is, but maybe there is a difference between believing a person enough to protect them and offer emotional support, hear them out and let them get calm until they can paint a full picture and keep the alleged perpetrator under close watch. The first step doesn't have to be destroying someone else's life without any nessesary evidence whatsoever."

The most frustrating for me personally is that men are largely expected to lead in dating and relationships, even if they are equally or less experienced than the person they are dating. This can make it really hard to enter the dating pool if you were never taught how to initiate the process, and with the litany of sex crimes notable men seem to be infuriatingly getting away with, the filters women are putting up for men are only getting thicker."

I think this really hurts men's ability to have meaningful and deep friendships when we can't show affection in public.

cryptolic1ous,h3rgbb5,1,"I am a computer science prof who spends an inordinate amount of time lost in thought, working through the details of research problems. When I am making progress on a problem, I often go for walks -- on autopilot. About two years ago, I was out for a stroll with my dog whilst pondering a very intriguing, but ultimately flawed, idea from paper I had just finished peer reviewing. And I was making progress. Until suddenly I was berated by a strange woman for ""staring"" at her. Honestly, before she got in my face, I hadn't the foggiest clue there was another human anywhere near me. I was staring into space, 100% of my concentration focused on a technical problem. I listened to her tell me what a creep I was, how if she ever saw me in that area again her police-officer husband would fuck me up, etc, etc. I apologized, went home, and jotted down what I had been thinking about.

Fast forward 3 months, I'm standing in front of a crowd at Sandia National Laboratories presenting the ideas I had been formulating whilst ""being a creep"" that day. The first question during the Q&A period was not a question at all; rather, it was a female scientist from Sandia thanking me ""on behalf of her children, 3 and 5, who, because of [research like mine], have a fighting chance of growing up into a world worth living in"".

In other words, a woman who has no idea what is going through my head accuses me of being a creep and threatens violence if she ever sees me walking me dog on a public path ever again. And then a different woman, upon learning what I was going through my head at the time, goes out of her way to thank me on behalf of future generations.

Every time I encounter an exchange on Reddit recounting some experience with a creepy guy (who did nothing more than be silently creepy), I cannot help but wonder if the guy was really being creepy, or if he was really just earning himself a Nobel peace prize and was accused of being creepy for being a male lost in thought."

busterlungs,h3rgf6i,1,"I had a friend at one point who had a minor drug offense (got pulled over, they found less than a gram of crushed weed under a floor mat. My buddy had been clean for a year or better before that, it was just his shitty old dirty car) so he lost his license. Caused him to lose his job. Went to a homeless shelter with his daughter (mother walked out and flat out disappeared, not like men can get child support or help from women anyways) who was 3-5 at the time. The homeless shelter literally turned him away, their reasoning being ""were sorry, we have space for men and single mother's but we aren't allowed to take single father's. If you can find somebody to give your daughter to you can come back by yourself."" 

And this wasn't the only homeless shelter he got turned away from. 2 others with this same stance. Ended up getting to this state which has better options for homeless people, got a job (although his wages are garnished paying for the ticket and tow that destroyed his life basically) and now has a place to live. So it's sort of worked out for him. But my point is, if you're down on your luck as a man. There is almost no options for you. Single father's are looked down on, and if you're a homeless chick there is no shortage of places to stay or people that are willing to help you. Not as a man. There are still some options like churches and if a shelter still has room, but there's a MUCH bigger stigma against men who are in a dark place in the world as opposed to women. This is one example i experienced from being homeless, but I've seen a lot more than just this that confirms it."

They must always be successes or they are less than. If they can’t do, then they aren’t useful, and if a man isn’t useful then he isn’t considered a man. If he doesn’t measure up to expectations, he’s a failure. Yes, women have societal expectations too, but society sticks up for the woman who’s “trying”. For men, it’s “do or do not. There is no try.” You’re literally bot allowed to not know how to do something and THEN are criticized for not asking for help. But id you do, your masculinity is immediately questioned because you shouldn’t need help because you’re a man.

Isthisthingon225,h3rgu2n,1,"I've never felt so connected to a reddit post in my life which seems to be both a positive/negative. I have a few that I wanted to share just in case anyone else like me is feeling similar.

I'm a young dad, I have five boys aged 8 to 1 and I'm just over 30. Sometimes I'm mistaken for their older brother when we're at the park or somewhere in public. However, my significant other is never mistaken for their sister even though she's actually 2 years younger than I am. I'm also a darkish half Panamanian man with brown eyes and brown hair, but 3 of my five sons are blonde and blue eyes like their mom so I do get side-eyed quite often when I have just my blondies.(Funny story, my Panamanian mom had to run out of a mall with my oldest who is light skin with blonde hair and blue eyes bawling over a toy. Luckily all she got was weird looks and my wife wasn't too far behind.)

Body image. I've never been a ""ripped"" six pack kind of guy and never will be. Even standing at 6ft and weighing 175lbs when I was younger, I was never fit enough for the male standard. I fluctuate between 200-230lbs due to working outside in hot conditions but in my eyes, it's all the same. I also had relatives that contributed to my warped body image because as a guy, weight shouldn't be important to me.

Communication. I love talking about sports, beer and work as much as any other gentleman out there. But sometimes the conversation needs to be more serious or substantial. Sometimes I stress to scrape together enough cash for our extremely overpriced apartment. Sometimes I just need someone there to listen to my worries about being ""dad"" enough for my boys. Or listen while I vent about my dad going to prison or a relative passing. My wife is in a plethora of ""mom"" groups on social media and we both talked about how hard it would be to start a similar ""dad"" group. I have a decent small support group, but it is relatively hard to discuss tough topics without feeling emasculated or ridiculed for being vulnerable.

Lastly, abuse. I have a coworker who's an older guy in his early 60s and his wife HATES him. Literally hates the poor guy and does not shy away from letting him know that. She has told him it would have been better if he died when he was hospitalized for double pneumonia, poured gasoline on him to light him on fire(they own a farm rescue together, and other disturbing things I'm sure I'm not remembering. His latest story was they went to a gas station together and she left him there when he went inside to get her something. She made him walk home when it was 110+ degrees, stopping every so often to ""let"" him in the vehicle just to drive away and circle back later. There's definitely a stigma attached to domestic abuse when it's the woman who's the abuser. She always tell him that he's the man, no one is going to believe him over her that he's being abused."

bros402,h3rgvix,1,"I am a guy. I went to college for K-6 Special Education. Education claims they want more men, but they don't.



I had the... misfortune of being placed in Kindergarten for student teaching. I was a last minute placement because my college fucking **sucked** at placing people - first school they tried to place me at, they sent me on an interview to see if the school would take me, start of the interview, the principal says ""I'm sorry, I don't know why they sent you here. I specifically told them to not send us any student teachers this year, but the message must've gotten lost.""


Told the college this, they took two weeks to ""confirm"" it


second place had lost its elementary school to Hurricane Sandy and was not accepting student teachers. I told the college this, they said ""You said that about the last school, too!""


3 weeks later, student teaching orientation that everyone at the college went to to meet their university supervisors, ""oh we haven't figured out a placemetn yet, haha it looks like you were right! I didn't see the note on my desk hahaha""


so, two weeks into the semester, I got placed in a Kindergarten. It was a full day K, but I had to split it between two classrooms because the teacher in the morning room only worked half the day, and the teacher there for the rest of the day wasn't tenured, so she couldn't supervise a student teacher.


So. now to the men's issues - In my first week, both teachers told me ""district rules"" that student teachers are not allowed to have physical contact with students because of insurance reasons. Student teachers cannot help kids take off or put on coats. Student teachers are not allowed to be alone in the room with students - if the teacher has to leave, the hall monitor has to watch the room with the door open. Student teachers are not allowed to help students with anything in the bathroom, even if the students are going to piss themselves.


So, I followed the rules, there were a lot of adorable hugs I could not reciprocate. Eventually, the other student teacher in the school and I talked at our co-requisite class and she said something that made me go ""But that's against the district policy!"" and she said ""no it isn't, who told you that?""


Next day, I asked my cooperating teacher - and she said that she and my other teacher asked the principal, and they said that I should follow those rules because otherwise ""parents might get the wrong idea.""



However, by that point in the semester, a kid in one of my classes had already pissed himself because I wasn't allowed to help him. My morning cooperating teacher left me with bathroom duty while she went off to have coffee with another teacher.



I still did not reciprocate physical contact much becuase autism - but sometimes I would pat them on the back if they hugged me.


One of the last days of my student teaching, two kids who loved me just grabbed both of my legs and started hugging and I shot my arms up in the air so nobody could think my hands were doing anything bad with those boys.


Afterwards, my cooperating teacher and I went to her room to clean up for the day, and she was like ""Why did you hug them back? You just shot your hands up in the air.""


and I told her that I am an adult male in kindergarten, the only one in the school, and I cannot risk someone seeing anything badly. She said ""well yeah but all of us were in the room so we saw what they were doing!"" (It was the gym filled with like 80 kindergarteners, so yeaaah their attention was elsewhere)



So I ended up getting near perfect reviews with a note of ""needs to be more physical with students""


I looked for a job for 13 months after that - had a 3.6 GPA, a slightly higher major GPA - and I was unable to get a job. I applied for around 120 jobs, had 8 interviews (including one as a full time classroom aide). One interview was... uhhh... interesting. I have a pretty popular generic white boy name, then spanish middle name.


The interview \was for a 3rd or 4th grade job - something in upper elementary. I get there a few minutes early, office was empty, principal's door was closed. Secretary comes in with a cup of coffee and says ""The IT interviews are in the board office across the street. I'm waiting for a Ms. [my lastname] to come in for an interview.""


I say ""Hi, I am [firstname lastname] and I am here for the teaching interview.""


Secretary says ""oh uh i'll go tell the principal""


all she says is ""Your 8:30 interview is here!""


Principal yells out ""Oh hey, come on in [firstname] and grab a seat!""


I walk in, she's arranging papers on her desk, she looks up with a smile on her face that disappears for maybe a second while her eyes BULGE out. Then she says ""oh uh hi take a seat, your resume looks good I see you went to [university]? I went there too. so why do you want to teach????"" and I answer it with at least what I think was a good answer and she says ""mhmm ok thank you for your time, if you don't hear back you didn't get hired.""


never heard back."

So many men take whatever person comes along first  in the panic that they need to lock something in before it’s too late.  And in turn end up in relationships that leave them traumatized , bitter , damaged and broken.  Worse is that they sometimes end up having children with these same partners which makes the trauma ongoing as they rarely end up with custody or much say in the children’s lives . 

There are a lot of problems in this thread . But I think if men and society could be more ok with just single men.  Going to movies alone.  Eating lunch alone. Having solo hobbies . Without the stigma of society giggling.

realbassist,h3ritpf,1,"I got 2, one with a story one without (afaik writing this part)

Number one, I was talking to some friends a while ago, female friends, and we were talking about... A youtuber accused of either sexual assault or rape, but I don't remember which. This was a few months ago now, I think.

Anyway, we got talking about it and we were really angry about it, and what the accusations were, cos we actually bonded because we liked this guy. We were all agreeing that it's horrific, and if he's let go then that's not a legal problem, that's a social problem, and that he should spend his life in pris...

""Sorry, I'm not sure I agree. If he's guilty then yeah of course, but we're talking like it's been ruled on, or that innocent until proven guilty isn't a thing.""

I then heard the most distressing and upsetting words I've heard from this person, it disturbed me on another level. ""It isn't a thing with rape, if you say they're innocent until proven guilty, you're siding with the rapist.""

It felt like I was being told ""The basic legal principles don't count in rape (a crime that, in my country, only men can commit in the eyes of the law) but also to say they do is the equivalent of defending such a crime!""

&#x200B;

Number 2, and I've seen this a lot on the thread so sorry for being repetitive, but I feel men can't talk about our issues as much as women. At school, I was bullied physically, and when I reported it to the school they openly told me they were treating it as a joke. I missed days of school for fear of being bullied and have nightmares to this day about it, and they basically said ""Get over it lmao"".

When a girl got hit once by a  guy, that guy was given what we called a ""Internal suspension"" (basically detention for an entire day) on the spot because, and I quote, ""We do not tolerate bullying of any kind here""."

TheBestTomo,h3rjsez,1,"Echoing what others have said. I've both been in daycare with younger kids because my mom worked it and I had to be there, as well as worked childcare for extra cash at my church when I was a teenager.

In the first case I got in trouble and was told to stop playing with a couple of the 1st grade girls who liked playing with me because it "" didn't look right."" I was like 12?

In the second case I quit because I got uncomfortable with the looks from parents, people who knew my mom and me because we'd been there literally since I was born. I think I was 17 when I quit that one?

I felt like I was good with kids when I was younger. I was always working with them in some way. At one point I thought it would be nice to work with kids in some way as part of a career. Now I'm not comfortable with them and in general I feel disconnected from that part of myself that could play and interact on that level."

Now I can't even get it up to real women, and porn barely does anything for me. I barely manage to dribble a drop of jizz into the toilet. Last week I finally lost my virginity (27m) to a stripper for 200 bucks and can't talk to anyone else about it. It wasn't a bad experience per say, but I was semi hard and barely enjoyed it. Now I'm wondering if I'll ever have a normal erection like I used to. Do women have this problem? Can they understand this shame, the pain when you can't perform?

Smashville1316,h3rqpx2,1,"I have been saying this for a while:

Men are judged based on how well they can provide, not what they can do.

Women now have predatory marriage/divorce tactics to gain income from multiple men and blame all the problems on the ex-husbands (And get away with it)
   -   Ever heard of a ""First Husband?"" 

Men lose roughly 80-90% of all custody cases in a divorce. 

With about half of all marriages ending in divorce, the women file first 80% of the time. The man can spend his entire life paying up into his financial position just for her to demand alimony/child support. She has rights to half of his shit depending on certain factors to include, but not limited to: Half of his salary for ""x"" amount of time, his car(s), house(s) (Sometimes, even if SHE cheats, she still gets the house. That one fucking bugs me a lot.), any assets like TV, appliances, furniture, gaming, jerseys, dogs/cats, stocks/bonds/options/retirement plan, etc. 
   -   If he has her sign a prenup, unless it is signed with a witness attorney, can be overturned if she claims it was under duress. 

Men have very few resources for a support system or mental health support. 

Men are looked at as creeps if they're at the park alone with *their own kids*

In terms of suicide, yes, women attempt it more, but men are far more successful with a suicide rate of about 70% in the US. 

Men make up ~90% of all homeless people in the US.

It’s not just men being horny, it’s actually somewhat helpful to do it every once in a while considering it actually helps relieve anger by relieving tension, and it’s been found that, on average, men that don’t masturbate have higher levels of anger than men that masturbate every once in a while. As long as it’s done privately, kept to yourself, and you are in a safe space where you don’t have to worry about being walked in on, men should feel okay for the most part on masturbating, because it can actually help."

God forbid you accidentally get a girl pregnant and she decides to keep it (against your choice)

Even if you date a girl and she just decides she wants to fuck with you by saying you raped her, by the time the dust settles, your life is fucked.

Not to mention seeing the hell my single father (and myself a few times) went through raising my sister since 4 YO. Not a single shopping trip without some lady butting in and my sister having to clarify.

I could be bitter about these experiences, but I think these higher standards are actually good. I'm happy there were women looking out for my little sister when she was with 'a older male'. I'm glad women get heard when they speak up now about their abuse. I'm glad that children will get the support they need whether they were wanted or not.

I had a possibly life saving brain surgery last year after finding a walnut sized brain tumor that needed out. I was working Healthcare at the time while also going to school full time during the pandemic as a disabled vet that deployed 2x

The women in my life, being my mom and my ex girlfriend, needed the help. THEY needed support. I had to reassure them everything would be okay. And when I asked people like my mom's brother and her cousin to try to help my mom out and be there for her, *they got on my fuckin case for not being emotionally supportive enough for her*.

I was literally told by my fuckin family that what I have gone through in my life so far left me better off coping with what ***I my self*** was going through, so I had to help the only 2 women in my life cope with what I was going through

8 months after my surgery I got into a pretty steep depressive state or what ever you want to call it, and my ex ended up breaking up with me because she said I was emotionally disconnected and the past year was too much for her and that she wished she broke up with me before my surgery.

itsjero,h3rtze3,1,"Depression, and overall mental health. A lot of men grew up raised by a generation that was raised with the mentality of ""suck it up, rub some dirt on it, just do it"" etc.

Men really havent been raised.. really ever.. with the idea that showing your feelings is a good thing. Weakness.. and really showing that weakness, is a bad thing and makes the world look down on you, makes you less appealing to potential mates regardless of your sexual orientation, and so much more.

Terms like ""mommas boy"" etc.. not crying at funerals, admitting you are hurt by things that have happened to you in life like the death of a loved one, parent, etc.

Also, as a male.. its somewhat indoctrinated that you are responsible for your families well being and overall rise to promenance. If you arent like some sort of super stud, all pro in some sport in high school, got lots of attention from the girls, and so much more.

So guys that dont check all those boxes are considered non alpha males.. and thats another thing.. being an ""alpha"". Just like women are taught to fit into a certain mold.. model body, super skinny, tan, large breasts.. ass.. etc.. If you dont fit into those catagories women are looked down upon as less attractive and less desirable.

Same goes for males just in different catagories. People cast aside who you are as a human, inside and out, if you dont tick all the boxes that women want. It goes both ways.

So youll have young males and females that ""sow their oats"" in a sense, and then later in life after the party phase is over, they eventually land a mate or partner that represents security, financial and more. Women want to ""marry up"" and thats been taught for a long, long time.

Its really sad to see honestly, and over time with the advancement of human beings as a civilization, certain things still, to this day, carry over and ultimately carry weight in terms of what youre worth to your significant other.

I mean hell, there is still arranged marriages, ""sow your oates"" sections of time in mostly male but over time also include females. The whole alpha image of a perfect husband or wife is based on tons of bullshit and ego that have been around since the dawn of us as human beings.

Then you have the whole ""who makes the first move"" ideal where men are expected to do the hunting when it comes to finding a significant other and more. Women are taught, super young, that they are to fill a specific role in the relationship. Cook, clean, birth children, and more. Just look at the ""toys"" that are made for each sex male/female.

Females have a toy set that includes like a fake kitchen, with fake food, etc. Toy ""vacuums"" and more. 

I mean do you think honestly, that any child would ask for a toy vacuum over other toys like legos, rubix cubes, and so on. As an adult you realize these things, that, as children growing up... these types of toys that are small replicated versions of the real deal.. like a kitchen set ( hell as parents my wifey got both of our girls a ""fake"" kitchen thing.. and the youngest ( 3yrs old ) absolutely LOVES ""fake food"". Like anytime we see it in a store or thrift shopping, she will flip the F out when she sees big huge things of fake food. i swear we have like over 400pcs of ""fake food"".

I was physically and mentally abused as a child until 15. I'm 21 now, I cry when I get yelled at because my brain thinks I'm going to get hit and I start to cover my head and face to protect myself. This is because during the abuse I faced when I was younger, if I got yelled at, it meant i would get hit with a belt or a knife.

Witty_Goose_7724,h3rul0a,1,"I am convinced it’s a cultural issue. And it doesn’t just occur to men in the US and the UK. It also occurs to women. I’m originally from Cuba and while I lived there and whenever I go back I get this sense of community. That every neighbor cares and looks out for another. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes as everyone is always in your business but at the same time you don’t feel lonely and are surrounded by people that are basically your family and are looking out for you. When I moved to the US I noticed the difference right away in the mentality towards others. It’s definitely a very individualistic culture here. I’m not saying it’s bad, but it does lead to more systematic loneliness. It’s still weird to me when my neighbors don’t know anyone else in my complex or even try to engage with anyone else. It’s become apparent with the pandemic how many people are suffering from extreme levels of loneliness in western society. It’s really sad but it can be avoided. I think the mentality that not needing anyone and being completely independent is the way to be, as admirable as it is, also makes people feel ashamed to approach others for help, which further exacerbates the problem. I think we need to adopt the mentality that it’s okay to be independent but to also understand the value of community and having solid relationships with other people. We’re evolutionarily wired to be social creatures for a reason. It is imperative to our survival."

Gr8GameCoach,h3rulfr,1,"I’ve got a male friend that is suffering severe emotional and domestic abuse at the hands of his ex-partner that he still lives with (because she won’t leave) and mother of their two very young children. 


She lied about taking birth control and because they were still intimate (they cohabitate), a pregnancy ensued. They were broken up but he is a very sweet person and an awesome dad so of course he ensured comfort. He began seeing another woman, all while letting his pregnant, jobless ex live in his home, and she had completely lost it. She has stalked the girl’s place of work, she has threatened to ruin his vehicle (their only means of transportation), she endangers her children by bringing them to the emergency room at all hours for attention while berating him on social media. She has threatened to call the police and said she will have him arrested if he’s seen with his new interest. 


She ended up doing just that. Police came to visit and found the claims baseless. He immediately went to seek a restraining order and forced eviction as her threats and abuse have become more erratic. He was immediately denied. 

She called police after he spit in her direction after more verbal abuse from her end and they arrested him. She field a restraining order and she was successful. No questions asked. 


This man is genuinely fearing for his life and is now not allowed to enter his home until his next court date all because a female’s rage and her word trumps any version of truth.

I’m not some sort of raging men’s rights guy or anything like that but even though the overwhelming majority of people would say that abusing a man is just as wrong as it is a woman, that’s not the reality. A lot of this can be seen in terms of cultural norms through both media as well as real world interactions. For example, movies where a woman slaps a man and the general reaction is “wow, he must’ve really fucked up to deserve that”. Same deal with respecting the sexuality of a lot of heterosexual men. I can speak from personal experiences outside of my external observations of the world. My sister was physically (and emotionally) abusive and genuinely tried to kill me once by pushing my down a flight of stairs so I punched her in the face so I didn’t take a 30ft fall. The moment she got hit she called my mom and when I explained the situation she just responded with “You’re both in trouble and men don’t put their hands on women”. As a child, that was so incredibly damaging and I’m just now starting to process that experience at 25 - something that occurred when I was twelve. Sure, maybe my experience might not be normal, but I know I’m not alone and I think a lot of toxicity has taken over in the current gender debate that really does more harm than good for both men and women."

I was a wrestler, rugby player, black belt in tae kwon do, she was a frail 5'4"" women, but she had ALL the physical power because if I ever so much as grabbed her hand when she was hitting me, she would call the police on me- and sometimes she'd call them on me even if she had hit me and I had just taken it. Granted, she's probably on the psychopathy scale, but the cops never, ever once even tried to figure out what was going on, they just took her word for it completely. Eventually, I just would leave the house when she got that way. Once, I wasn't wearing shoes when I left, and walked all the way to my Dad's, about three miles away without them- she called the cops on him for kidnapping. So, the next time I left, I walked to the police station instead, and told them that I was 14, that my mom had started hitting me, so I left of my own accord. I asked them to call my dad to come pick me up. *They called my mom instead.* I felt like there was literally nowhere I could go, that she could get at me anywhere.

Never happened to me or anybody I know, but it’s a terrible role reversal between standard victim and victimizer. Chicks get support groups, guys get made fun of and told to “man up”.

PottedRosePetal,h3rvzyc,1,"So Lots of people here say loneliness. I think my point is kind of one reason for said loneliness. What I notice in the twenties is that a lot of people just have unrealistic standards about their partner. I think this comes from stuff like Instagram or tinder where you see beautiful people all the time and compare yourself. Now where is the problem for men? Men are horny fucks. That means, a fuckboy on tinder can have a new one every day if he really wants to and is good looking. On the other hand if someone is not good looking, it will probably take some time to find someone on tinder. This means those are more likely to be dissatisfied with tinder and uninstall it. The effect is, people who just fuck around a lot have the app, ""ugly"" people don't. This creates a warped picture of men to women on tinder. Now, tinder is just an example. This same effect kicks everywhere online, the not so good looking part of men does get proportionally less attention than the good looking part. And good looking can also mean being nice or simping. It's warped in any case. And the dangerous part is, you go through so many different people and then just see one imperfection and women tend to go ""ew, GG go next"". I have yet to hear that from men, but to be fair, I don't know popular men. In it's extreme that's the cliche of ""he has to be 180 tall, muscular af, good humor, 20cm dick..."" And on the other hand, men are way less picky. Ofc some men are. Those that can afford it. But since many men just swipe everyone right on tinder and women like 10% since they always get a match, that just warps the dating market in a weird way that makes no gender happy. Ofc, that only applies online. Offline you can just talk to women. But the issue there is, you often get so many different opinions about that online that it can feel scarier than it is, especially since there is an online alternative and people online said how disgusting they felt when someone hit on them or smth."

the average man spends 14% more time at work. hes 11x more likely to die there. men choose the highest paid specializations which are chemical engineers, aerospace engineer, math and computer scientists, pharma. and petroleum engineer which are all more than 60% men. in some of them as high as 90% yet. young (ages 22-30) childless women outearn yooung, childless men by 8% if we account for all factors such as work place tasks and other factors. its 15% but people still think women are discriminated against in the form of pay.

fathers and mens day are judged as misogynistic or hateful to women but same cant be said about mothers and womens day.

  
here i am just naming a few of mens problems and i barely have time to get started on how most of this is because of feminism. but ill give you a brief summary:

  
even if we ignore all the hateful things feminist leaders have said about men. all of the policies promoted by feminism which are harmful to men (such as the duluth model.) and all of the times feminists have protested and disrupted mens issues conferences. feminism at its very core is an anti-male ideology  
feminist theory is entirely predicated on the notion that there exists a patriarchy which gives systematic advantages to men at the expense of women, even ignoring the fact that this is demonstratably untrue as evidenced by the fact that a woman can steal a mans sperm or rape him an then sue him for child support. men get harsher sentences for equicalent crimes, men are required to sign up for selective service just to qualify for federal aid or to get a drivers license, among other things (see above.) feminists cannot acknowledge the systematic inequalities faced by men as doing so would undermine the most fundamental premise of theur ideology, after all, men wouldnt face any systematic disadvanteges if there actually existed a patriarchal system designed to privilege them. this is why feminists are often hostile to mens rights advocacy; any acknowledgement that men might not have it so great is a threat to feminism itself, and so feminism has to be hostile to mens rights and therefore cannot be accurately descrived as a movement for equality. feminists do hate men. if you are a feminist and you dont hate men, you should stop calling yourself a feminist, instead call yourself an eqalitarian or a humanitarian"

TexasMonk,h3s116n,1,"The fact that society only accepts men being emotionally vulnerable and open in two situations that don't really get discussed:

1. In committed relationships - obviously, it is a good thing to be able to be emotionally vulnerable and open in ways that are unique to committed relationships. We pick up early in life that this is the only area where it's not taboo to be vulnerable. However, the learned exclusivity of the entire emotional spectrum, outside of anger and laughter, being restricted committed relationships has a few downsides. Guys, especially teens and early twenties, mistake emotional intimacy for romantic interest. They are taught to  view those things as inherently intertwined, which is why the idea of ""friendzoning"" is so painful to them and why guys routinely fall in love with their female friends. Secondly, breakups often put men in a situation where they feel their entire emotional support base has chosen to leave them. Men will endure horribly toxic relationships in silence because they fear losing what little emotional support the other person occasionally provides and often have no one they can discuss it with. It's also common to feel like no one will care and that they will probably be blamed for the situation.
2. While getting drunk with their male friends - most men have had a good cathartic emotional conversation while drunk with his friends, as I'm sure most women have. With guys, however, this is often the only time they feel allowed to do so and regularly do not reinitiate those conversations while sober. That was ""the alcohol talking."" This creates a few problems. One, men often come to associate being drunk with the feeling of emotional comfort so they are more likely to drink when sad or depressed. Two, they feel as if deep meaningful connections with their friends require alcohol. Guys, how often does hanging out and talking with your friends involve alcohol? If a guy chooses to stop drinking, while not being in a committed relationship, he suddenly has to quit using the one tool that allowed him emotionally connect with those people and sometimes loses that friend group if he cannot be around the alcohol for his own well-being."

They literally were on leave when it was alleged that they assaulted someone. If anyone had done the slightest amount of inspection into the allegations they would have immediately have seen that they were bullshit. The people who accused him got no punishment, and now he doesn’t feel safe at his own job. Justice should be on the basis of innocence unless proven guilty, and it sucks that this logic doesn’t apply to sexual assault. What sucks even more is that these exact same women have complained that men never believe sexual assault victims, placing the issue on men instead of the women who make it difficult for people to tell when its real and when its bullshit. It astounds me how pseudo feminists will defend women who pull this BS yet complain that men won’t believe every single case of sexual assault regardless of any evidence."
Klatterbyne,h3s2z2q,1,"Not to be hyperbolic… but basically all of them. But I’d say the core of it is a fundamental societal double standard.

Men have multiple times higher rates of mental health issues, homelessness and suicide than women. And men’s mental health has only just become something that people have vaguely started to look at. Men are routinely turned away from homeless shelters while women are given all the help they can manage.

Impossible physical standards in the media (which I think is a wrongly couched issue anyway). Scarlett Johansson can be on a poster next to Chris Hemsworth and theres an uproar about how her casual fitness physique is utterly unachievable and unrealistic… while not a word is said about Hemsworth’s physique which requires every aspect of his life to be tailored around it and then requires a pre-shoot pump-up workout; so is literally unachievable in real life.
On a similar note, a male talk show host talking about an actresses body is creepy… but Ellen Degeneres can do a “guess the body part” topless slideshow about Chris Evans and its fine.

Engineering being male dominated is unacceptable… but no-one says a word about nursing and primary social care being completely female dominated.

Women can condescendingly shut men out of discourse as and when they want… but “mansplaining” is apparently a serious issue.

When men earn more than women (without considering major differences in working hours and conditions) its a major problem. When women earn more than men… its progress.

The list goes on. Regardless of the issues themselves, the fundamental double standard runs through the lot. And all we seem to be doing as a society is heaping new double standards on top of old double standards (theres plenty that run the opposite way) and calling it “progress”. Nothing seems to be actually getting fixed."

SeraphtheSilent,h3s3fm0,1,"Two things that get some attention but that we don't have answers for. 
The death of Chivalry and the double standard of work. 

The fear that the world has of me. 

 Chivalry is dead and in some ways that's a good thing because patriarchy has been used to oppress women. However in many situations there is still a double standard that expects the men to take on a specific or unfair workload such as lifting boxes handling confrontation and in some cases snap decision making.  This is not true of course in all environments and not true with all individuals but I have seen a trend in this that is upsetting in my life.  And the killer thing is I like to do those things I like to carry the heavier things If I can I like to handle confrontation even though it's awful because then someone else doesn't have to and sometimes I'm in a position to make a decision when it's important to make a decision. But it does frustrate me sometimes when we have equal work descriptions equal opportunity and an unequal burden of work. And in all fairness women have their own discrimination in things that they're expected to do so there's that. Maybe it just sucks for everyone. 

The 2nd one is kind of an echo of things that have been said throughout this thread men who when seen with children are viewed as predators and men who when they approach women are seen as a burden or as an offense. These are both sadly based in statistical realities which is really shitty.  But it really hurts my soul when a random woman looks at me and I see fear and I mean nothing towards her and to her. It does not help my social anxiety I'm sure. And let's not even speak of how that affects romantic attachments. It also erodes your own self image which is tough it's an insidious thing to counteract in your own mind when you see reflected in the people around you fear or discussed it makes you doubt yourself. I believe that some self doubt is helpful it takes pride down a notch and gives you room to improve and it can also be a crippling thing. When you cannot think rightly of yourself it is hard to see the right thing to do. 

TLDR:  Men are supposed to be equal but aren't always expected to do equal things. People fear men and that fear is internalized by them. Also I'm gonna go have a nice cry. Much love sorry for the long book."

EagleSoaring_,h3s3ksl,1,"Two of the biggest issues I've faced as a man that I have rarely ever seen mentioned or discussed which kind of feed into each other is the assumption of a violent personality/behaviour and that either I am not interested or incapable of caring for children and by extension being a good father and if I am interested, I must be a pedophile.

I've lost count of the amount of times people have simply assumed I'm a violent person based almost exclusively on the fact that I am male.

 For a time I was actively seeking employment as an early care aid/ educator for children. From the onset when I would tell people that it was my career aspiration I would bombarded with comments ranging from ""Really? But you're a guy, caretaking/education is more of a womanly thing."" all the way to ""You're a fuckinf weirdo, the only guys that care about children are pedos"". 

I had literal interviews where I would be told that they appreciate my interest but ""out of concern for the well being of the children"" they were hiring a different candidate and every single time I was beaten out by a female. They either assumed I was a pedophile or for some reason assumed some kind of physical harm could fall upon the children because I ""wouldn't be able to control my temper"". I have no history of anger issues.

That wasn't exclusive to me as an adult. When I was a kid (like 13-16 range) I would try, salient word TRY, to babysit for money. I'd be able to get a gig here or there from family friends and such but aside from that I would get weirded out responses from acquainted adults looking for babysitters and one mother said and I quote, ""What kind of mother would I be if I trusted my baby girl with a boy????"" (The girl was like 4). 

Feeding into this stuff is this assumption of bad behaviour. In middle school I was bullied relentlessly by this group of like 3 girls, not only did the faculty not believe that I was capable of being bullied by girls because I had a penis, they also would believe the outlandish claims they would make against me to get me in trouble. 

This is a real story, one day  I was called into the principal's office and when I entered the principal's office I saw one of the girls who bullied me sitting there with her arm in a sling. The accusation against me was that the girl was claiming I had broken her arm by throwing a piece of broken concrete at her arm. Not only would I need an outrageous amount of human strength that no 11 year old could have, I also physically could not have been able to do it because she specifically stated where on the school grounds I had broken her arm during recess. 

The thing was at that point I was on the other side of the school's property spending my entire recess with a yard duty for a punishment for getting into a snowball fight with some friends.  The yard duty himself came into the principal's office to testify on my behalf. The principal disregarded both what me and the yard duty were saying because not only was I a boy, the yard duty was also a man. So the principal, who mind you, was female decided to disregard literal faculty testimony that stated I literally could not have done it and chose to believe the girl and I was suspended for 2 weeks. The kicker is I later heard from one of my friends that 2 days later that girl stopped coming into school with her arm in a sling and apparently her broken arm had miraculously healed over the course of 2 days."

Eggboi4000,h3s58z6,1,"Here is my list;

Loneliness; Men struggle a lot with being on their own. I think women have grown and developed the emotional maturity to be comfortable with other women, so there is a support system when life decides to crack jokes with their lives. Now men could develop the same emotional system, but it's not encouraged at a young age, and as such, when they grow older, they're very much left unprepared for what life has to throw at them. I'm assuming by men, we're talking about your CIS male guy. I, for my case, learned very early on to be in tune with my emotions, express them whenever I'm in odds, and allow myself to be emotional with other people. I'm going to a particular path of darkness right now, and i'm blessed that i've got a vast support system that can help me out and make sure i'm happy even in these times of loneliness.

Emotions; Men are not encouraged to be in tune with their emotions. Often they're encouraged to either ignore them or disregard them entirely. I don't know if this one is overlooked, but I think it should be on the list regardless.

Expectations: Often, men are expected to not develop their emotional sensitivity or be soft. When I was going to get my COVID vaccination, I told the nurse that I really didn't like needles or the whole process. I allowed myself to feel my emotions and be present in the moment. I asked her if I could get a juice carton, and she said yes. While I was waiting, I was feeling pretty scared, and before I knew it a whole group of people were around me trying to comfort me which I was very moved by. I got another juice carton, and after a while, when I felt better, I thanked all of them for their help and went on with my day. We're all human at the end of the day, and if something sucks, then it sucks. In the corner of my eyes, I could see other men in the waiting room who had such envy in their eyes over how I was being treated. I wasn't going to go with what is expected of typically male behaviour. I allowed myself to be vulnerable, and the staff naturally sympathised with this vulnerability and helped me out. 

Vulnerability: men are often encouraged not to be soft or vulnerable but rather tough and jaded. 

The inability to complement other men; probably goes with the expectations and loneliness that I mentioned above, but men don't hype up positively. They don't support each other in the same way that women do."

Sliphatos,h3s6qvv,1,"People actually think being a tall guy is great. It's not. The world is not designed for us. I'm 6'8"" and the amount of times I have to be careful walking through doors or ducking under branches from low hanging trees is crazy. That doesn't sound so bad? Well, what about having to stuff yourself inside vehicles because they often are not big enough to give you ample legroom or headroom and you have to be careful about bumps and potholes, otherwise you risk injury to your neck. Airplane raides can be a pain at times not because I I'm too wide to fit in the confines of my seat, but too long. Imagine having to sit at times hunched over with your knees digging into the back of the seat in front of you for hours.    

Or how about me as a big guy always being thought of as a source of unrelenting physical strength? Granted yes, in my prime I could perform some pretty considerable feats: pushing an entire wooden pallet filled with boxes with a single arm when I'm at 100% or carrying multiple rolls of heavy fabric over a shoulder, but there are days when I am not always at my best and over long periods of time even my strength wanes. Despite using proper techniques for lifting and pulling objects, some days pain can be physically crippling and if not for a mind used to an aching lower back, knee and feet, I'd falter and fall on the spot. People see a few moments of seemingly boundless strength and then expect it always, but the truth is no one can be at their best all day. And even worse truth is that if not for the moments anyone exhibits their full potential, people are lesser impressed and think less of you. It is only because of the exhibitions that people see any real value in me and if I were to just be average it would not be good enough.     


This same strength physically is also keeps some people away, as people can think of you to be vain or even dangerous, simply because how tall or big you are. Adults and especially women often openly tell you about how scary you are to them on first appearance. It brings me no comfort to learn I scare people on first glance, but I've grown to accept it and try to be as friendly as possible, usually with a smile on my face. But it doesn't hurt any less every time I hear it.     
   

The disappointment people have on their faces and in their voices when you tell them that you are not into sports and that you didn't play Basketball or Football in school because of how tall you are never gets old. I've only ever had one person in my life ever tell me that my interests in things like computers and music, gaming and reading were well placed and not me ""wasting my talent"" as if being tall automatically grants you a perfect aptitude for whatever physical sport they think you should play instead of things you actually have an interest in. No one has ever come up to me saying I should be a musician, despite anyone who speaks with me for 5 mins knowing how much I love music. I am not seen for who I am or what I want to be, but what people expect of me, especially physically.    

Imagine being told not to cry or be emotional growing up and being ridiculed because as a ""big guy"" you should be able to bear whatever pain comes your way physically or emotionally, despite having some of these that never go away. I've always had lower back pain, even as a skinny 6ft tall teenager and some emotional pain from being beat on by an older brother and a father when you weren't so big.     

But big men, hell a many men of all sizes, never get a chance to really vent their feelings about the pain they feel, sometimes for years or on a constant basis because then they are weak and effeminate individuals worthy of being mocked.        


People clown on those guys who read and write poetry, but at the same time will idolize singers and rappers. Folks love to criticize men in theater for being ""gay"" but worship TV and movie actors. Maybe things are different now, but it was like that for me growing up.   


A game I like said it best, ""I'm big, but I feel small inside"". I'm always careful how I am around people, even if they don't show the same care for me. Because that's how it is."

At the start of the year, my wife lost our second child at 18 weeks, however we found out at the time that Peanut had passed away at 12 weeks. We agreed that during the delivery, we didn't want to meet Peanut. 

Through varying circumstance, Peanut was born at home, and it was my responsibility to wrap my child in a blanket and take them to the hospital. That moment of holding my tiny, perfect, deceased child has left me with severe PTSD that I am now only starting to address. 

Miscarriage and baby loss is an incredibly taboo subject, and most Mothers come out of the other side and the experience is often belittled, or worse, ignored by those around you. It needs to be spoken about more to validate the experience of the Mothers. 

I genuinely believe that this is, at the very least, as severe of a problem for men, as it is never discussed in earnest. There are support groups set up for Mothers, but in the UK, there is no formal post-loss support for the Fathers in any way.

But as a men it's more difficult to share your trip with unknown people. Yes, it's easy to talk, and get some info. But there are way more doubts about you. Among women there's always the suspicion if you just want sex or do some harm, and among men, some of them are only worried about girls, and some other want to feel empowered by themselves doing their trip alone.

damnsignins,h3sao1k,1,"This will sound extremely stupid (even to me kinda) but men's clothing is absolutely stupid. We're expected to fit into some relatively specific clothing most days and its limited as hell. Mostly jeans or slacks and t-shirts or collared shirts. The color range is crap and the storage (my issue) is small as hell.

Pants/jeans come in about five colors. Black, blue, beige, grey or tan. Anything else requires a specially store or paying excessively. We're meant to live in the blandest colors available by retail stocking choices.

And pockets are to on the back and two on the outer thighs. And on dress pants, the thigh pockets are all, ""Make it easy to get pickpocketed"" vertical openings that everything can fall out off. 

And anything that comes along that adds more space and is comfortable dies fast. ""Fanny"" packs, leg packs, belt pouches, just about ANYTHING  similar results in mockery. And don't even bother carrying around anything that could possibly be mistaken for a purse. We have to lug around backpacks or suitcases just to keep anything useful around.

Its not even ""male minimalism"" or whatever they call it. Its essentially a male uniform code we're born into and can't complain about. And its annoying as shit because saying, ""Fuck it, I'm not going along with this bullshit,"" is an open invitation for anyone to nitpick and criticize for daring to own certain color clothing or have extra storage space that's not luggage."

Nothing ever happened from it other than her posting Al over Facebook about how I hit her or whatever. But she was fucking crazy. That relationship ruined my mental health. Literally ruined it. I know you just see my side of the story, so it is one sided. But trust me.

capt-yossarius,h3sbisi,1,"Not every 'what-about-ism' a man gives a woman when discussing a complex social issue is an attempt to shut her down.

To be fair, some are.  I wouldn't care to claim what percentage are, but clearly some are.  But occasionally when a man gives a 'what-about' response, he is responding to a thing she has said, where she is making a justified complaint about an issue women deal with, but has framed it as something *only* women deal with, when this is not the case.  There are plenty of issues that aren't male or female problems, but human problems, if only we'd be willing to see them that way.

An example I suspect is common is the issue of *objectification*.  It's a complaint I have found common among women, and justifiably so.  But it isn't an issue unique to women.  I just seems to me when men are objectified, it isn't generally on the basis of sex.  I believe it is most common when women are objectified, it is as sex objects.  But when men are objectified, it is most commonly as objects of utility."
BallisticDrizzt,h3sbjo4,1,Abuse.
ElTel88,h3sbmc8,1,"For me (and I assume many) it is the dropping off of the athletic peak. 

I'm from England and was raised at a time where most men made and kept friends through sport. I was never forced into it, I absolutely loved (and still do) any football, rugby, squash, climbing etc I could get my hands on. 

It's a shame, because we were never told to embrace openness and feelings in the way the young generation are, rightfully, being encouraged to be. But through sports, you got locker room talk (much more friendly conversation and shit talking that the Trump version), you had a chance to prove yourself, improve and win/draw/lose with mates. 

So really quickly that team becomes your friendship bed rock. 

You look forward to training to see your mates and catch a drink afterwards, it was almost always free of women (which made a difference if you are talking something personal), it was a lovely safe space to borrow a phrase loads of ""blokes"" would scoff at whilst ignoring the fact they were in one and loved it. 

People's athletic/skill sets mean they drop off at different ages, be it injury, slowing down in terms of pace or as much as anything, family commitments. 

I am in the twilight of my ""actually still pretty good"" of playing rugby. All the experience and tricks of the trade I have in the bag are probably going to not be worth enough in 2 or so years time when the 18 years olds popping up at the club will have more time under their belt and speed I no longer have. 

It sounds a silly thing to mourn, but I've been going to a rugby club on a Saturday since I was 14, when that comes to an end at around the 21 years of playing mark, it will be a big loss in my life. I know for a fact I won't enjoy playing over age rugby (I love what I do on the pitch as I've never been the best, but I've pushed myself at each level I've played at), suddenly being far and away faster than a 48 year old isn't interesting, so I will walk away until I have kids of playing age - if and only if they want to play - and, as a great deal of men know, that group of friends won't remain the same without the routine + new things to talk about based on new games, club experiences etc. From experience, a lot of the old heads who stick around get nostalgic and no one wants to be in a nostalgia bubble. 


To avoid this decent into an althetically challenges life, we have taken up golf to have something else to keep that group together and doing something similar with each other that is competitive, ends in a bar and gets us outdoors. 

Three of the mates I have, their Mrs put their foot down (to have it reversed when the above is explained) because they didn't want to be with a clichéd golf bore. All changed their mind after chatting about why going out to play some sport with your friends is important. Because for 90% of men who play a sport, it's not a fight with obsessive desire to be the best, it's mostly something you enjoy doing and an excuse to stay in good contact with your friends in a way a lot of men struggle to justify or follow through on without sports as the binding agent.

Edit: forgot to mention the difficulty that sports reveal about the decent of your athletic peak. Suddenly, you're not the speed merchant of your youth, you see kids you remember teaching the basics to aged 9 arriving in the squad and being stronger than you ever were, it's a very literal example of the passing of time and, in its own way, a reminder of your mortality. You were once a 6 packed early 20 year old something who took any oppertunity to walk back to the clubhouse with your shirt off to (in your mind if nowhere else) impress those watching, suddenly you're working 40 odd hours a week, going to taster menus with your partner and her friends that add on seemingly 2kg each time and eventually being seen with your shirt off by those same people terrifies you as to show off your athletic decline."
GAYVIDBOWIES,h3sbo0u,1,"Not being/feeling capable of expressing themselves. I have lived around and with men since forever and when they get to a place where they feel comfortable with me the exact same things come up.

 - Not being allowed to appear sensitive in public spaces in fear of being viewed as weak or lesser than.
 - Not feeling strong enough to give into a hobby, fashion style or general lifestyle in fear of being judged and rejected by their peers.

A close friend once begged me not to use the fact that he's once cried in my arms, after he had lost a family member, against him.
It is terrifying how men are required to be these idealistic piles of muscles who cannot feel anything and are expected to only like things made for manly-man who communicate through groans.

The male gaze is what is hurting most men, especially heterosexual ones who are desperate to find a partner without understanding that what women want isn't necessarily what they have been forced to become. 
Thankfully nowadays the internet is reaching more people and teaching them it is okay to be themselves, listen to their desires and those who truly cares about them.

Boys, if some of you happen to read this :
- Cry if you need to cry.
- Go to a therapist if you feel you need it.
- Have fun with what feels good. 
- Dress how you want to dress.
- Communicate with loved ones.

And the worst part? If a guy is down and out after a streak of 15 consecutive rejections and vents about it, he's instantly branded an incel and is told to stop acting so entitled and get over it. Um no, incels are a different breed ENTIRELY to a man who is frustrated because every girl they've ever asked out has rejected him.

*conscription. American Men MUST sign up for the selective service or face 250k in fines and/or jailtime AND being banned from a huge amount of government services (like student loans). If the man gets jailtime, he loses his right to vote. Women dont have to do this. 

* Lack of reproductive rights. Men have no say in the decision to have a baby. This includes when the man or boy is raped or the discarded condom is used by the woman (or the woman's friend). There was a court case in the US that a woman who gave oral sex to a man and kept the semen to later impregnate herself had every right to do so because the semen ""was a gift"". Legally, she could have given it to a complete stranger. Men also have no legal roght to know the reproduced. A woman can hide a child from a man, raise it herself, or give it up for adoption without informing the father. Men's legal rights start once he suspects the child is his. And he cant stop an adoption until he proves it. 

*parental rights. Men cannot opt out of parenthood. Not legally. The best they can do is ask the mother's permission to give up parental rights and responsibility. Which in the US means nothing because the mother can come back at any time and demand child support since courts tend to go for ""what's best for the child"" and reverse the decision. Many states have loopholes in adoption where a known father doesnt have to be informed or give permission for a child to be adopted. 

*lack of abuse shelters. Or just being recognized as a victim. Statistically, most domestic violence is reciprocated (both parties attack each other). Women are more likely to start reciprocated violence (hit first). Statistically, men who call the police for help are more likely to be arrested than the attacking woman. Multiple social experiments were done (around the world) that consistently show that a man being beaten by a woman in public will rarely be take seriously (even if she has a weapon like a blunt object or hot coffee). Male on female domestic violence however was immediately seen as a problem and people rushed to help the female victim. 

*court bias. American men on average receive 63% longer sentence than women for the same crime and similar criminal history. This is a disparity SIX TIMES larger than black vs white americans. Men are also more likely to have the police called on them, be arrested, be convicted, be incarcerated. Get the death penalty and are less likely to get parole compared to a woman who does the same action. This is a glaring systematic inequality that many lawyers and judges recognize. Lawyers who have a guilty client LOVE getting women because the woman will likely get a lower sentencing, and they can take credit for it. 

*gendered crime definitions. Most of the world's population lives in a country with a gendered rape definition.  As in either only men can be rapists by definition or only women can be victims. Many places also have different definitions for assault, exhibition, domestic violence, etc. Which means men MUST be punished harsher than women by law. There are also countries where capital punishment can only be given to men. Like a mother who beheaded her child while intoxicated got prison time while the boyfriend, who merely handed her the knife, got the death penalty. Many states have gendered crime definitions to this day, including the FBI. 

*government funding is skewed. Men lead in almost every major cause of death (they tie in one and women die more of one cause of death). However government health research funding in the US is about twice as high for women than for men. It should be proportionate to victims. Studies on issues men face also dont get government funding. Many states literally state that they only give funding for studies on women and childre
 If the topic is gendered issues. Many if not most governements (including the US) that fund abuse shelters, only give funding for women's shelters. Men's shelters get nothing. Not government funding, and rarely public funding. 

*No one cares about men. The best example is #bringbackourgirls. Boko Haram went around kidnapping around 300 girls and the world lost their minds. It was all over social media, mainstream media, celebrities and politicians were talking about those girls. The problem? Boko Haram was *also* KILLING *AND* KIDNAPPING over 10000 boys. See, their religion restricted them from killing women and girls, but boys and men were fair game. The only coverage of killed or kidnapped boys (forced to be soldiers) was the loca media in those countries. But more than 99% of the coverage focused on the girls. This means the lives of under 300 girls COMPLETELY ECLIPSES the lives of over 10000 boys.

 *""This is a women's issue!""* in fact, many ""women's issues"" are gender neutral or experienced more by men. We as a society just care more about the safety of women. For example ""women are scared to walk around at night in fear of being murdered! Men dont understand!"". Statistically, men make up the majority of assault and murder victims by strangers. Women are actually safer just for being women. But the whole ""just women things"" trend for being cautious is lretty common. 

*Police brutality like with sentencing, men face police brutality at much higher rates than any other group (including black people. A white man for instance is more likely to be targetted than a black woman). But saying ""male lives matter"" will get you laughed at because no one cares about men. 

I could go on and on, but i have stuff to do. The point is that men face many systematic inequalities that no politican (male or female) will touch because it's political suicide to care about men. Because society sees men's rights and men's issues as a joke."

1. The impacts of the pussification of boys and young men who eventually have to go out and compete for a place in the dominance hierarchy. 

Simultaneously

2. The unspoken truth about the true nature of women, especially those raise in broken families or by scuzzy morally corrupt mothers, and the wholesale damage this does to men trying to ""do the right thing"" in creating relationships and families. 

3. The family court system's bias against men and favoring of mothers in support and child custody cases. 

4. All of the above plus the economy that cannot support a family broken by divorce and family failure. 

5. Parents not teaching or forewarning boys what awaits them after high school, about nature of institutional systems and women usually to use men at disposable property. (I cut some slack for young women because they are not taught either) 

6. ""Women are, men do"". This quote I discussed with my youngest son the other day.

There is a campaign at my workplace promoting the emancipation and unequality of minorities, people with disabilities and women. I greatly support such causes and everybody's emancipatory moment in general. Share the love we are all people. 

But instead of embodying some form of humanistic equality, all of the campaign is biased against men.

The problem gets more sincere in that it is all biased surrounding the white male in combination with the fact that in our office there are 27.1% male workers. The males that do work for this government have technical jobs (me) or low wage jobs. At my university studying social sciences more then 60% where women. In all social sciences related jobs men are big minorities, yet generalisation keep resulting in campaigns making my position in office or social jobs much harder.

As a side note, I almost got the cops called on me, because I went to help my sister at school (she's a teacher, I'm a big muscular man, I can lift ALL boxes and reach the tallest cupboards, hear me roar). Lady teacher didn't see my visitors' pass and didn't call out to talk to me, she was just following 'to make sure'. Well, turns out she was shit are stalking because she lost sight of me.

First thing I know that I almost got the cops called on me is when my sister walks into the room and informs me that I apparently made someone panic. I joked about it, but in all honesty I was extremely offended."

,h3shmtd,1,"Sexual assault. Verbal abuse from women. People telling you to get over being self conscious about your looks, especially your body. Being victims of assault far more often than women but ignored because the perpetrators are also men even though they feel sympathy for women who are assaulted physically and/or sexually by other women. Men being put in prison because they literally couldn't afford to pay child support even though they tried and yet the preborn can be killed by their mother. The mother can decide if the child lives or dies and the father has to either lose his child or be forced to pay child support and women say that he shouldn't have had sex if he didn't want that to happen even though they say that women should be able to fuck whomever they want and then do whatever afterward. People don't care that fathers have said they felt like a chunk of them was killed when their child was. 

Men are punished far more for the same crimes. Boys are basically told from the time they're able to talk that they will eventually have to have a career when they grow up but women can do whatever. If she fails college, she can just be a stay at home mom while her husband would be seen as a failure of a human being. Girls can figure out what they want to do for years after a boy who's expected to know what to do for work for the rest of his life immediately after he graduates high school and he's supposed to go directly into college, fully decided on what he wants to go for. (From what I've seen at least.)

Fathers are often seen as predators and can't even take their kids to park without people at least giving them the stink eye, sometimes even saying they'll call the police or they tell them to get away from the kids. It happens because of the teeny tiny percentage of men in history who have been pedos while women are also pedos and yet they aren't seen that way. Just in the UK, between 2005 and 2006, 2,142 children reported being sexually assaulted by a female. 

I hear in the news about female teachers ""being in a relationship"" with students usually around the age of twelve and luckily they're arrested, but the reactions are usually still blaming the male even though he's twelve and it wouldn't matter how much a child begged and plead with me to ""be in a relationship"" with them. Obviously no matter what the situation is, there's no justifying that. It's also about half and half of men and women who abuse their partners and yet the women being the perpetrators is overlooked because people don't care about male victims."

Christopharo91,h3skr30,1,"First, thank you for asking this question.

Some issues that immediately come to mind is emotional states, physical weaknesses and physical deformities (beneath the skin)

I say this because not only a few friends of mine but I also suffer from this.

The Medical field, employment and society for the most part, looks at me and sees a handsome(ish) capable looking young 30 year old who is either lying or is simply too young to be having my kind of issues.

I have a twisted ribcage due to structural kyphoscoliosis (curvature of both the upper and lower spine). Because of that it can be difficult to breathe some days let alone move and being that it's structural doctors from 7 different states have told me that it's inoperable and I just have to deal with it until it becomes too much of a problem. In which case surgery is an option but only then is it an option.

Mental states that follow this is unfortunately understandably hard to explain. Depression, self-confidence issues, self-hate, feeling unwanted/unworthy, etc.

The worst part about mental state issues... Especially as a guy/man... Most people don't give a single shit. Not even therapists. They think people your a male that you should just toughen up, grow a spine (haha, funny not really), and get over it.

Men are meant to be superhuman, emotionless and capable of being able to not only jump but jump from her to Pluto doing inhuman amounts of tricks and acrobatics.

What happens if you fall short of that, you might ask? You're look at as not only weak, but as an embarrassment and someone who is less than human that is too pitiful to live yet somehow still does.

Bonus thing before I hop off my pedastal... I was a miracle baby. I was a failed abortion that made it. I had a thread about 3 centimeters of torn umbilical cord still attached to the placenta. I have been looked down on my entire life because not only am I differently abled. I shouldn't have lived."

Kasuto_of_Kataan,h3sl1mn,1,"Testicular torsion. I had it back in high school (2000). The top symptom is enormous pain in your balls. Not me, though.

The first sign, in hindsight, was a deep pain in my abdomen. I thought I was constipated. I went home early from school and Mom got me a laxative. I took a shit, but it didn't get better.

A day later the pain spread to my balls. It wasn't that bad, it felt more like I pulled a muscle.

The day after that was a day I'll never forget. I woke up in extreme pain. My left nut was swollen to 3 times its normal size. The left side of my dick was so swollen that the head was pushed to the right. Gross.

Mom and Dad took me to the ER. Had the usual STD questions (nope), got taken to the hospital. A really hot tech did an ultrasound on my balls.

Verdict was in: my left testicle was dead. It had spun around the vas deferens and blood vessels by 720 degrees. It had to be removed. I had a 1 hour surgery to remove it.

I was in so much pain. Just unbelievable. I wanted to die. But when I woke up, the pain was just... Gone. The sense of relief was unimaginable.

Turns out, as a preemie born 10 weeks early, this is a common thing. The surgeon tied down my other nut so this won't happen again.

But, the best part is that my Mom is weird. She went to the pathology dept and talked to the lonely guy there. And to this day, I have my left nut in a jar of ethanol. It is sliced into pieces (for biopsy reasons), but it's there. I replace the ethanol every few years with 80% alcohol and the rest distilled water.

My left nut will be old enough to drink (on the US) this year.

So, if you have weird, unexplainable abdominal pain, or severe pain in your balls, go to the doctor. Also, this condition seems to be common with preemies. If your a man, and a preemie, see a urologist."

Richardsnotmyname,h3slula,1,"Sexual Violence in general.

There have been a significant amount of studies that prove that **men are either as likely to get raped**, or at least a lot more than we previously thought. 

I think most people here believe that most if not all rape victims are women, either due to the idea of men being stronger and from statistics like [this](https://stoprape.humboldt.edu/statistics) one that states that 91% of rape victims are women.

However the 91% statistics only define rape as forced penetration of a vagina, mouth or a us, which is very hard to do without a penis.

When you count force to penetrate, the number is a lot closer to 50/50.

[This survey](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm)  conducted by the CDC in 2012 found that 1.6% of females reported being raped within 12 months before the survey.

For men the number of males forced to penetrate is 1.7%.

[This study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1748355) finds that 48% of people who self-report rape/attempts to rape are women.


Even when fitting the conventional definition of rape, boys tend to get raped younger. [1 in 8 victim of rape experienced rape before the age of 10.
The number for boys is 1 in 4, double the amount.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/fastfact.html) 

The numbers of men who are victim of sexual violence is actually very close to women's, with every [1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men experiencing some sort of sexual violence during their life time.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/fastfact.html)

Hedgehogsm8,h3sq0kz,1,"All the serious issues have been covered so I feel comfortable saying URINALS

What the FUCK is with those things?? Some urinals have little divides between them to try and hide other dude's penises but they're almost never tall enough to be effective, and that's when the building have actually bothered to put those divides in, because lile 95% of public toilets do not have them.

And it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't need to look down, which we absolutely should not have to, but most urinals that I've come across have that weird plastic bit in them that's like a tall thumbtack with hollow stripes. Yknow what I'm talking about? And if you're not *EXTREMELY* careful with your aim on those things then the piss just bounces off them and onto your legs. Fucking WHY?? What purpose does that thing serve? So you almost *need* to look down at where you're peeing.

Now, it is quite easy to just ignore that there are other dicks around if you laser-focus on your piss stream or if you just look upwards or forwards and risk spraying yourself with urine, but the knowledge that someone could be looking at your dick is just uncomfortable, and it's even worse when the guy next to you *is* looking up but you glance down to check you're doing alright and then you KNOW that he knows that you've just looked down and it definitely looks like you might have just grabbed a glance at his member and he just has to hope that you didn't because there's fuckall you can do about it now.

Plus the issues of kids using urinals too. You NEED to make sure you are looking away from that kid, which almost guarantees that you'll have piss bounce onto your legs, because if there is even the *SLIGHTEST* chance that someone in that room thinks you might have caught a glance of that kids dick, or God forbid, you do look down at yourself for a second and your peripheral vision just, y'know, exists, and you accidentally DO see something then that would be enough to send me into a bed-ridden state of despair.

Even as a kid, I was so much shorter than other people. I definitely accidentally saw dicks at the urinals. They're just not a good idea and never have been. I've never bothered looking up who invented urinals, but if it's a guy then I bet any money they're a sadistic psychopath who's goal was to make people misserable."

I haven't gone through this myself but 2 very close friends have and I can tell you the while process and result has torn them appart. Women are seen as the carers and usually given most of the custody, the father has their family taken from them. Something they have dedicated their life to. One friend says how the system see him as a money earner and not much else. He's a great guy, is amazing with his kids and the kids love him.

Loneliness can be a serious mental (and physical) health threat. Find a way to connect with a group of people, even if casually. A very good option is a church or other faith community. If you really aren't sure that whole God thing is for you, try the Unitarians as a way to connect with other people who may feel much the same as you do. Just showing up at such a community more than once a blue moon will lead to connections. If you end up attending a large church (more than 100 in a service), look around for a small group (most have ""Mens Fellowship"" groups, which in most churches are an excuse to go to lunch once a week and gripe about the local sports team, but hey, it's a start)."

s_jk11,h3sup1q,1,"As a woman I can say there are women who exist in the world searching for vulnerable men! This is a sad world and these days w social media you get praised for trying to be “raw and real” but its so fake for the aesthetics nobody even knows what raw and real actually means.

As a therapist with my male clients I see this all the time! Personally I feel it is beautiful to see a man be vulnerable and share insecurities. We are all made of masculine and feminine energy. I feel the world is hardening us and I do agree that society does not provide a safe space for men to be vulnerable.
Many woman these days can barely handle their own emotions that are forever changing. We are all human and it saddens me to see how much this society requires men to be the “tough” ones.

Emotions are weird and I know women that can’t even handle the emotions of their female friends. I also know many women are selfish and only want people to surround them w support for their needs but it is not reciprocated when its their turn to be supportive. 

When my husband is sensitive or cries I rush over w open arms to hold space for him because I know, its a gift to see a man in a vulnerable state like that.

Sharing that bond not only enhances the relationship physically and mentally. It builds trust!
My husband is Punjabi and I also have to take into consideration cultural aspects in relation to masculinity too, and I had to be patient with him and still do. It took time for him to get comfortable to be vulnerable. I mean, he married a therapist. I am always down to talk about emotions. 

I believe it takes time and being w the right person. A TRUE adult. 

Now with that said. We have to change our mentality. If woman are out here saying all men are the same ladeedah they attract more of it. (Trust, I have been there and had to change my mindset and my narrative of men) 

If your narrative is that woman who are accepting of sensitive men are rare, well then, thats your reality. 

As a basic human, I am on this earth to hold space for people. The fact is, a lot if people don’t even know how to do that. Everybody wants support but no one wants to give it to another. 

My heart goes out to you men on here! 

I truly hope you all find the one who is willing to hold space for you w/o judgment ❤️"

It’s no surprise to anyone that men commit the most crimes and have a higher suicide rate etc. yet no one wants to focus on the source of all this pain for men.

How does one remove all this pain ? Maybe try to raise all children equally. We’re always careful about the emotions of a girl/woman but never for those of boys/men. No love, affection and compliments for men starting like 12 years old (sometimes younger), which leads to lack of confidence, which leads to men being lonely and anger. 

All this rhetoric right now about all men being the enemy and we’re all dangerous to women and all that just brings another layer of men being frustrated and the feeling of being misunderstood, or simply the feeling of being put in a basket with every rapist on earth. For years we’ve been the cause of every problem and are being told we are the problem but nothing will change in the way we are being raised and taught things.

She once came at him with a knife, just holding it pointing it at him and asking him why there were people in his contacts she didn't know, she went through his phone and wrote down every number. Just to see who exactly he communicated with.

Every time they would go on holiday she would sit in the caravan, didn't give a shit about the kids and often flirted in mean spirit with other men, but when my dad had a female friend she got pissed. The worst part was the end of the relationship, my dad went to Iraq as a soldier, and had given his mum access to his banks. Apparently the bitch of a wife had stolen the details and bought a load of booze, had male fuckfriends around and partied. When he came back, she had bought another house, almost completely drained his bank and left his mother, who never said a bad word about anyone, in tears. She had moved away, and while he was in Iraq, the kids had stayed with grandma, so she attempted to take them with her.

Now hardly anyone makes contact with her. I have never even met her but from the combined stories of my dad and sisters it's clear that she was an abusive woman.

It is not equal rights that a man should be required to fight in a war and a woman isn't. It isn't equal rights that anyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity, ethnicity, color of skin, body type, anything that makes them the individual they are, is subjected to different rules, obligations, than anyone else. You can't make every child who wants to be a doctor, be a doctor but you damn well better give every child the environment and education where they can be that if they are capable of it.

I would see him hit my mom, yell at her, and eventually started hitting me and cussing me out all the time. The drinking stopped, but he kept hitting me until I was about 19. 

I remember once during middle school, I did something that upset him, and he was hitting me yelling and throwing me across the room. Must have been pretty bad because the neighbor knocked on the front door and asked what was going on. My dad told her to mind her own business and she said she would call the cops. My dad said if I said anything to them that he would get arrested and never see me again, it would be my fault. I told the cops nothing was wrong. 

Another time in middle school I was changing for PE class and a classmate asked why I had red lines all over my back. I didn’t know what he was talking about but my dad had recently hit me with the belt. Really embarrassing. 


Finally when I was 19, my dad woke me up really early on a Saturday, was yelling at me, and started hitting me. My dad told my mom to take my sister and leave the house for a while. He locked the door to his room and beat the shit out of me, breaking my nose. It’s still crooked today as my parents didn’t want me going to the hospital. This was over my dad going through my phone and found i was sexting with my gf at the time. 

Never knew how much my upbringing affected me until I moved in with my fiancé. I’ve never hit her or any woman, but even after a year of therapy, I still have a temper and yell. It’s not as bad, still working on it. 

Because of my dad, I don’t drink ever and I work at least 2 jobs (he never really had been able to have a job for more than a couple of years). I don’t ever want to be like my dad. I rarely talk to him now.

I don't mean in the sense of walking out into the world like they own it, because arrogance is a turn off, but someone who's content in their own skin. My boyfriend has gone through a lot of challenges in his life, but he's genuinely happy with who he is, he knows what he likes to do, he knows the things that he loves, and he's not ashamed of it.

If you do any one thing for yourself, learn how to love yourself. That is the most attractive trait any man can have."

Ophelia_is_Gone,h3t6zoo,1,"As a woman selling Men’s clothing there are two major things that come to mind. The first is the insecurity men face, and others have already touched on it but there’s more to it. Men are constantly bombarded with the idea of being a ‘manly man’ they aren’t allowed to enjoy taking care of themselves and getting dressed up. Doing things like taking care of your hair/nails and other general hygiene things are seen as being ‘gay’ or ‘girlie’ so a lot of men just simply don’t do it. They don’t realize it but they’re only hurting themselves in the long run. They come into my store and lack confidence in how they look, but doing simple everyday things like washing your face better and trimming your beard regularly will make a big difference in how you feel and how you look, giving you that confidence. The second issue is that in general men don’t express themselves or communicate well. We put more pressure on girls to be the negotiators and peace keepers in the family, so they develop stronger skills in expressing themselves and understanding others. Men are stuck in a small space and struggle to communicate how they feel, simply because they do not have the proper words and the skills that come with using those words. Most of my day is helping men to articulate what it is they want and how they feel about their clothes. In general this is something I see more in younger guys who lack confidence. A lot of professionals that are negotiating on a day to day basis have developed this type of communication, but I also have men late in life that can’t tell me what they don’t like about a particular item…they just don’t like it."

In following generations, over half of children with autism spectrum disorder will have a father who has been diagnosed with ASD at some point in their life.

abaum220,h3t83xf,1,"This is going to sound like a joke reply but it’s not. 

In puberty years, every penis having person has a few years of getting random erections and it’s embarrassing, intrusive and never talked about. 

I spent several years in middle school and early high school thinking I was a total freak and being very unsure that this would ever stop. I had anxiety about ever sitting down and I made my “fashion choices” around how I could hide this sex crime in my pants. 
Being that no one ever, ever talked about this, I thought I was alone and therefore, I obviously couldn’t talk about it with anyone either. I resorted to wearing an athletic cup for a whole year at school (something I’ve never told anyone) and to hide that truly embarrassing fact, on gym class days, I’d have to wear my gym clothes under my normal clothes to avoid anyone seeing that I had a boner blockade on at all times. 

You grow up and find out that everyone goes through this and you feel a sense of kinship with those who share this terrible history like we were drafted in the same secret war and did what we had to to survive. 

Recently, and I don’t know how it came up but I think my wife had asked me a question regarding male genitalia, I found out there is a whole wikihow article for the young ones going through this all about how to hide unwanted boners. It hit me with a real sadness that there are kids today still probably totally unaware that every penis having person has or is dealing with this and, conversely, they’re probably totally sure that this is some sort of freakish medical condition that will never go away and demands the utmost shame and secrecy."

-gnarbot,h3ufxfo,1,"In times past men were responsible for the protection, financial stability, and moral leadership of a family and household. The drastic and rapid departure from that assumed duty has many men who were raised traditionally left with a lack of direction and maybe fulfillment, and a confusion as to what their role is supposed to look like now, especially in secular households.
   In much of the media, and the propaganda issued  by certain overrepresented parties, their traditional role is even demonized, furthering the listless lifestyle of so many younger men as society discourages the fulfillment of the roles their fathers taught them. 
    When I hear people talk about the fact that rich white men rule the world, I remind them that for thousands of years, rule and control were taken at the edge of  a sword. 
  Men had to be strong, smart, motivated and resolute simply to gain enough control over their immediate surroundings to improve their circumstances, or determine their own fates. 

Also, Women did not have the simple things we take for granted in modern society, such as birth conrtol and even tampons, and childrearing required more direct attention than it does today, so it fell to the man to challenge the world and provide for his family. 
    Often in our egalitarian society this history is forgotten. Times have changed, and I believe in equal oppourtunnity for everyone.  I have no problem with women doing whatever they want. If you want to be a CEO, go out and climb the ladder and you can acheive. 
  Its when people start to rail against a ""male dominated society"" that I point this out...not everyhthing changes at once, its all a journey, and perhaps we can push for equality without hating men for their willingness to accept conflict and leadership roles for the thousands of years that it was in fact required of them."

The rest of your assumptions regarding the information contained in my original comment somehow saying that this process is “simple”, or “a regular occurrence”, etc. seem to have been influenced by me typing “everyone *can*” *(do this thing of which you speak)*, in a later comment. This phrase was obviously echoing your own use of those words, in the slightly sarcastic spirit of being brief when referring you to my previous comment wherein I’d already answered the question after you’d asked it the first time, so you had no reason to believe I was saying that this happens regularly, or that it is a simple process.

Since I’d already made it clear that the legal process in question was not “the norm”, by using the phrase “...in some cases...” (or words to that effect), I can only conclude that you had, once again, either forgotten or dismissed the fact that I had neither stated nor eluded to either of those things perhaps being possible. Still, I regret particularly my toungue-in-cheek echo of the word “can” in that comment, as you seem to have latched onto it and then formed opinions which led to making incorrect assumptions, etc. but this was not my doing, of course, as I’d already explained myself in a statement which you’d just read.

In other words, I understand you feel that I’ve said something you don’t like, but I did not say these things. 

Reading my comments should make this clear. Please stop attempting to put words in my mouth.

CheezeGweez,h3w90g5,1,"Honestly the biggest issue with men in general is self sabotage. Sometimes when you have issues you want to walk the line. Sometimes you want to cross it even if you know it comes with the consequences that you don't like going through but in the moment for a second the imagination can take you elsewhere. This is where self dominion comes in handy and I bet a lot of older men will not feel the same self sabotage as I do. I have learned through out the years that if you have the little things in check then you can focus your energy on your priorities. When you realize that something's can be measured by percentages and you realize the difference between taking a chance and self sabotaging yourself, then you can make investments or give or take opportunities. However I have seen many men self sabotage their relationships on purpose."

See we where high school sweet hearts and shee had never even kissed a person before. So that went on and i fond text and then her going to friends places then we split plus have two kids together. When i started getting ready to date it was good and had sex with one girl that i had got into so we started dating hard.  Then the ex felt uneasy and approached me sexually and I declined and got depressed and if it wasn't for my new love i probably would have killed my self but she wouldn't have that she listened to me and understood my problems and now im back to a strong relationship with her again she overlooked my sex depression state and showed me what friends are for.

No_Film_2086,h4867u1,1,"Parental Duty / Just a babysitter

As a father of 3, I take a very active part in my kids life - I'm now separated and divorcing from my Ex, and am the primary parent (they live with me 95% of the time). The reaction that this gets is one of amazement or incredulity that as a man, I'm unable to be a sole single parent. I get that its not the standard, but its not exactly rare nowadays, but the responses I get are ones of pity for my kids that ""they only have a dad"".

I'm not knocking single mums in this by the way, I KNOW how hard it, but society accept single mums as a perfectly valid family choice, single dads are seen as bumbling and incapable of looking after their own kids - this goes into normal family life as well, where dads are seen the same - incapable of caring for a child, and just there as a baby sitter

Even during a normal relationship, I was constantly jokingly referred to as the Baby Sitter, and not seen on an equal footing to their Mother.

This kind of adds to the Mental Health issue, and the other issues around not talking about real problems to other men

When you search the website for ""Men and Gender Equality"" there is nothing. Maybe a para or two on how men always have it better, oh, and that men die sooner etc.

So this same department came up with the Gender Based Analysis+ process. Link: [GBA+](https://femmes-egalite-genres.canada.ca/en/gender-based-analysis-plus.html)  There is not one sentence that begins with ""Men and women"" it's always ""Women and..""  This program permeates every level of government to ensure that women's needs have been met in every government process, contract and decision. Not one mention of men's needs/considerations. Everyone in government also had to take this course.

Then, the depression sets in. And the rest of your life (single or not) becomes just....numb, neutral, etc.

And if you even TRY to look for solace or comfort among those groups that are ""there to help""...

Eg; A cousin was assaulted. There was a FB post she commented on that was for people who'd been through it. I put a hashtag MeToo in support of her, not even for myself...and the amount of anger, ridicule, hate etc I got from both male and female members of the group....and then when I replied to say that it doesn't only happen to women, I was basically told that unless I was a woman or child, i was talking crap. Then, my cousin replied with something I was trying to say but couldn't find the words: The child? She or HE grows up. But only the girls get help and support after a certain age. The boys? Clench your butt-cheeks and walk it off.

admiral_bloodout,h7wnpq7,1,"Men being insecure about their personality and the person they are. This sort of thing is often really sad to see, because if everyone was so much more honest and wasn’t scared about portraying an image then everyone would just be so much happier. I see a lot of guys my age try and act hard or pretend to be so tough but in actuality they are more alone than anybody. I notice all of these guys who hang around eachother and act like this don’t actually have any real friends despite being in such large groups because they can’t be honest about who they actually are

I played sports and was on all kinds of sports teams and I’m sure you can guess all the people I met there. But it was kinda sad actually. Because I noticed all they ever talked about sex, cars, and partying but had no real passion or any individuality. I was a pretty confident and extroverted guy who was generally pretty tough but I had good friends who I would just be myself around. And the most fun and happiest I’ve ever been in my life wasn’t spent partying or having sex, it was actually just seeing my Bros and talking about anime or making stupid jokes and all that. And I could comfortably tell them about my creativity and express it to them. And because of that I’ve actually been really pushing forward with writing manga and comics. And I can say that I feel a lot more at peace in my life than any of those guys I met. Because they became such shells of a human in order to try and appear a certain way in front of others

You don’t need to the guy you think other guys will accept, because there are so many other people like you who will relate to you and you can actually connect with. Being who you truly are on the inside takes a lot of courage but you will always end up way more happier than the people with no passion for anything. Who cares if you love comics or anime, find some friends who also like that stuff and you will feel much happier. If you have a passion for astrology then why not discuss it? Being yourself and having individuality is the best thing you can do for yourself. And it comes with rewards. You have better friends, and even though many think the opposite, with my experience, people who are geeks and nerds are way more interesting to women because they have so much more interesting things to talk about and they are never boring"

Hollywood induced beauty standards are funny point of discussion for example. Those are mostly painted a female problem.   
But I always like to point out most men don't look like Chris Hemsworth either, in both appeal and physique.   
Nor is that a reasonably standard for us to live by. Chris's litteral job is to look like that, and there's constantly somebody with him to whip him into shape and that life litterally makes him millions.   
You can't begin to hope to compete with that on the off hours of your full time office job.

It's also hard to talk to a lot of  guys about subjects that aren't in the sphere of the stereotypical alpha male.  
Anything that basicly is a display of any kind of vulnerability is pretty much a taboo in a huge number of circles.

HamstersInMyAss,h3pxwn1,-3,"Basically that the traditional male social role is completely toxic, and anybody who adheres to it too much either finds themselves as a belligerent asshole, antisocial & subversive psychopath, or an outright suicide case (sometimes a mix of all of the above).

I think unfortunately feminism doesn't address this as much as it should. Without this being tackled, there is no such thing as equality. I also think the problem is, as a society, we are empowering women to take up traditional male social roles, when in reality we should be reexamining both male and female traditional social roles on a fundamental level. Empowering women to take up traditional male social status does erode the inequality a little bit, but it doesn't address the foundation of the problem-- which is that our ideal of 'male virtue' is an inherently bad and closed-off way to look at life.

I understand *why* feminism doesn't address this very much in the current context, it being reactionary and understandably unconcerned with men as victims of their own game-- I'm just saying, it directly affects everyone and it's a conversation we should be having; 'what is a man, ~~a miserable little pile of secret~~s and why should it be so?' rather than 'I can do/be anything a man can. Everyone strive for traditional male virtue.'. When/if we can get to that point, I think real progress and cooperation will be the reward.

You can blame behavior on chemicals/hormones to a certain extent, but when you know the undercurrent of vainglorious, territorial, materialistic machismo that is manhood, there is no question what the ultimate culprit of male aggression, depression and universal chauvinism is. This is certainly not a modern problem, but it would be nice to have modern solutions before we blow the fucking planet up. You can use the 'nature' crutch as much as you like, but ultimately we know for a fact that as humans we have a unique capacity for nurturing desired traits/ideas/ideals. It's just how it is until it isn't."

And thus, whatever your feelings in the issue are because you have been indoctrinated, or aren't educated enough, or you are just an asshole.

That all this garbage then radicalizes young men and they often adopt toxic worldviews because they want to *feel like men,* but then get told that is toxic - so if the world is going to see me as toxic, fuck the world then.

Or, it leaves young men out in the cold because they don't fit the toxic definitions.

That feminism wants women to set the standards for women, and tell men it's not about them... and then also define masculinity, because it *is* about women. And then wonder why men are fucked up.

Yet, this isn't the fault of women, or feminism - truly, it is not. And, at the same time, there are aspects of this harm that are.

BunnyLovesApples,h3ryypi,-1,"Toxic masculinity and supporting patriarchy and holding yourself and others accountable.
I know this sounds like feminism bullshit but it really isn't. It's just feminism

This system was initially build to control others that are not white males but it turned against men by targeting their feminine behavior. 

Boys had to be a certain way when they grew up, weren't allowed certain things because they are considered unmanly and are punished for being themselves.

Patriarchy is just shit. Women are harassed, can't get a good job easily, access to health care is made harder for them and so on. For men it is also shit. High burnout rates, high suicide rates and many more.
It targets both men and women but men still are the ones who enforce it the most. 

Holding yourself and others accountable is really important because it can change a lot. 
It can make others see that the behavior is wrong and if you do it yourself can relief the stigma that admitting to have done wrong is bad.
You should always question yourself and if what you are doing is okay or not and how you can change for the better.

Of course this includes many more things but in the end it boils down to the system we live in that inflicts all these problems and the fact that it is still supported."

Men were made to stand upright not with their shoulders rounded forward like some geek clerk in a shoe store. And all this horseshit about toxic masculinity,? Really how about toxic ignorance toxic namby-pamby.?

It's the difference between and Alvin Alda and a Clint Eastwood. Driving a Prius versus driving a Ford Raptor. Carrying a 22 Derringer when you should be carrying a Glock 17 with hollow points. And since they've made it a cultural and political proposition it's the difference between voting for a party that thinks it's fine to let people enter our country illegally and partake of benefits that are subsidized by the taxpayer, versus a party that insist on legal immigration not importing illegal aliens to be your next new voter base as is the case with the Democrats.

I reject the notion that we must shy away from political discussion so much of the political actions taking place now affect all of us locally on an individual level that it is impossible to escape these facts.

 Do I really want my local Planning and Zoning Board to have to abide by laws that say we have to equip our town with government housing projects when we were doing just fine without all the crime graft drug dealing and moronic behavior that accompanies public housing. Personally speaking I don't need to hear some moron cruising around at all hours of the night with 22in Dub rims on their car playing really crappy rap music. There's a lot to think about but for sure none of the negative stuff would take place in an atmosphere permitted by alpha males oh, men who are not afraid to stand up for their rights and the rights of their fellow citizens in their local municipalities.

And it is Marxism leftism communism whatever you want to call it because this effort to usurp control of elected political leaders from the state and local precincts was something that was done in Russia immediately following the end of the Yeltsin era. The government in Moscow was in charge of appointing not electing local Governors and local Parliament members and they amended the Russian Constitution to reflect this. I never saw the Republicans advocating for state and local authorities to cede control of their elections to a central Authority in Washington because that's an American. In summary I will tell you this American men need to stand up and grow a pair of balls and stop taking shit from lesser men who have no balls, no ambition and very little intelligence.

Another is paternity fraud. If a woman is not monogamous she can trick a man into raising another man's child. That is a lot of work, not his responsibility, and takes away the the number of children he has. Women guilt men out of paternity tests playing on, ""You don't trust me?""

I got out of that pool and approached that man and in a stern voice told him he should be ashamed of himself and that he needed to leave the pool area before I make a scene if you don’t. He looked perplexed that I approached him jumped up and ran off. I didn’t cause a scene just spoke to him in a regular tone but boy was I boiling inside! I didn’t want my girls to notice nor want to ruin the fun they were having at that moment because of this creep. It’s astounding how many man will actually do these type of things out in the open with so many present. I have encountered this type of thing at parks and once at Walmart. I did in fact turn into a Karen at Walmart since the guy was just way out of line and for what ever reason decided to follow me with my children. But like I said I wonder what these other individuals have experienced for them to be on guard when a make is present around children.

SketchyFella_,h3tvprd,0,"Girls have days where their mood is determined by something their vagina is doing... so do men. It's not as often or severe, but sometimes the tip of my dong just won't stay out of the neck skin (I'm circumcised) and it's really uncomfortable."
Fjellbjorn,h3u0x6e,0,Pretty much all of them. If you're a man and you advocate for yourself on any issue you're seen as a pussy by other men.

ArEmOh,h3unodr,0,"All of them. The whole ""toxic masculinity"" thing stems from a system built on the fact that men are conditioned to be nothing more than worker drones. No emotions, act like a man, shut the fuck up."
Dave7NY,h3upj7i,0,"It’s tough for me to read through the many issues that so many of you men go through… Here’s my abbreviated story and maybe it helps someone.

I found myself alone and scared of my own rage a number of years ago. I couldn’t share it with family (they’d just blame me for my actions) or my girlfriend (she was even more scared of me than I was) or so called friends (they’d judge me and make me feel worse). I didn’t know where to go for support. I needed a group of men who could hear and see me rage and support me anyways so I could improve and heal. (Newsflash, rage is my reaction to pain.) So I was introduced to ‘The Mankind Project’ and it’s been freakin life changing. I now have a close group of friends who(m?) I support and who support me through thick or thin. No judgment, no unsolicited advice, none of that. It’s a place to be real, supportive, and I am pushed to cut through the bullshit stories I tell myself (negative self beliefs) so I can rise and be the better version of myself. I still rage but not as severely or as often. Most importantly, I’m not alone and am working on it.

Check out the mkp organization (non-profit) if you’re looking for this kind of support. Changed my life…"

Accomplished-Pea1267,h3v76s2,0,"I consider this a tragically serious, complex, and preventable misunderstanding in many mainstream cultures among those who identify as male and those who identify as female (for example). It hurts folks' core-often our very purpose in life-here; we mean men. Please pardon these huge generalizations while I try to describe briefly:   There is a part of well-meaning ""modern (or 60's feminism)"" in some areas that allowed for minimizing or making fun of subjects and ways of being that are often considered priority for males (let's use terms like honor, chivalry, helping, fixing, heroism, numbers-bonding, life-saving, etc.) and often considered unimportant, shallow, ""schmaltzy"" or even rude by women.  Just as many terms & ways of being that are considered priority for females like simple (and often deeply bonding) chatting, sharing, loving, complaining (venting), etc. are often considered unimportant, shallow, or ""schmaltzy"" by men.

 Allison Armstrong (PAX) talks about it. I learned about it in the 70's growing up around different inquirer's (along the gender spectrum). The different gender identities simply don't know how important it is to respect or learn the other's language, or even that there are language & perception distinctions.  

Of course; Folks along the gender spectrum can experience it more dramatically, with added discrimination and disenfranchisement. 

Once the different perspectives and languages are learned and respected, it can be transformative. 

Some African Americans use the term Womanism; respecting womanly & manly traits. Many traditional cultures get it right or wrong, depending on their level of mutual respect, appreciation, and empowerment. 

I wish it were taught in school, including the whole spectrum, including non and blended identities with associated languaging. I always use it with clients.

 Anyone else want to share about respectful publications & trainings around this topic like Alison Armstrong's work?"
MountBurrGold,h3vf8d1,0,"after reading the comments I feel now is the time to speak. When I was 5 my male cousin (same age) showed me a graphic black and white pornographic magazine. I wondered why we're they pouring milk on his dick? That image has been burned into my brain. Shortly after this his sister 4 and I, and he with my sister 4, all jumped under blankets to experiment.  My female cousin 4 said I have a hole and she wanted me to put my finger in it. I had no idea what she meant but started moving my finger in the dark until it went in her bum. She said that's my bum, put your dick in me and she grabbed my dick and put it on her vagina. I still had no idea what she meant but my penis was hard so I slide it over her pussy. Later, I don't know if it was weeks or months she told me to wait in her garden shed out the back. Shortly after she came out, got on her knees, unzipped my fly and began sucking. She sucked my dick until my eyes were rolling. This experience has been burned into my mind from such a young age and determined the path of my life. I am now 45, have ptsd, clinical depression, chronic pain and I am also divorced"

Rich-Exit4378,h42b2hm,0,"When they can’t clean, keep sheets on their beds, or shower regularly. It is not my (M 22 bi) or any woman’s, non-binary folks either, problem to deal with. I’m not some pretty, poor little thing that was meant to be your crutch. Don’t invite me to your nasty a** apartment without cleaning first. Then, don’t try to flex and crowd my space when the garbage is rotting five feet away. 

So many men think they have to fit a doctrine of masculinity which creates residual issues like above. This person clearly had no business dating, should have been in therapy, and has bigger fish to fry in general. Having to interact with men like this has forced me to tackle my own sense of shame, how much pressure there was to date, how little support men have for trauma/PTSD, and question why other men try so hard to emasculate me. I even questioned if there are ways I don’t take care of myself, though I am meticulously clean. It is so competitive with other men too. If you make other men feel insecure at all things get weird and friendships fall apart. I have never connected with another man in my life in a way that was purely innocent and friendly in nature. Male friendships have always become unbearably competitive or end up getting hyper-sexualized. 

I don’t know what triggered this rant. But everything about how little attention is given to societal pressures men are facing bothers me. Everything about that situation just made me go, ‘Huh.’ It is all wrapped up in my trauma, self-image, and sense of security."
