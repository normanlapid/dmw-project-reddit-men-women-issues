The number of unreported cases is much higher, but naturally we don't know what the statistics are there.

Ask a woman or girl when they first noticed men gazing lustfully at them. It's way younger than you might think. I'm not talking about puberty, a lot of them said around 7 or 8. Younger than that, it's probably not so much that men weren't looking, it's that they were too innocent to notice.

As a guy, it's easy to say women and girls control the dating scene. Consent is more important for females, guys have to pursue gals, they say women have their pick from a bunch of guys, they say an average woman can pull a much more attractive guy, but an average guy can't necessarily pull an average gal, let alone a more attractive one in most cases... much of this may be true, but women have experienced much more abuse at the hands of men, so they have to be more careful.

I say it qualifies for this thread because posting the ""1 in 4"" statistic is a good way to get brigaded by ""men's rights"" groups on Reddit. I'm not going to name any, but if you don't know of them, you're better off. Incels, the lot of them, some more veiled than others."

Women get paid less than men for doing the same work, correcting for all variables, especially in the field of medicine. Gynecology is one of the most repulsive examples of this if you ask me. 

People believe being a stay at home mom means you aren’t working, when it is often more difficult than actually going to work, if you have a couple of babies. It is viewed by our society as a privilege given to you by your husband, when daycare may cost a whole partner’s salary. Many stay at home moms are so taken for granted and financially and emotionally abused by their husbands, that they don’t even know how unfair their lives are. Interestingly, when mother’s work just as much as their husbands, most end up doing 75% of the parenting, most of the household chores, and typically managing the household - appointments, plans, bills, etc.

Only to be told that they are not a high priority as it's probably just their period/pms. Then come to find out it was something serious, such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy that burst the fallopian tube, that needed emergency treatment hours ago.

Our pains, moodiness, depression, etc almost always get diagnosed as pms or period problems no matter how severe. Like we don't know our own bodies and the fact that we would know when something doesn't feel right.. Let alone us being able to decide how to treat our own bodies. Want a hysterotomy due to a medical issues or even just the fact that you are 100% sure you don't want kids? Nope, sorry but not really sorry, you need to wait until you discuss this with your husband. You don't want kids, well you  might change your mind later. Oh not married? Well guess you're waiting until a complete medical emergency, marriage or menopause. But a man wants to go in and get a vasectomy? Sure thing bud/pal/bro.

Abusive boyfriends/husbands and the long term psychological effects/trauma it causes to women and their children. Often the woman is blamed for “not leaving him” or “not leaving sooner”, etc when the issue is far, far more complex that that. No one usually does anything meaningful to support or help and as a result this continues for years.

Health and hormones. Menopause is not discussed or not in healthy ways. I grew up terrified of it and confused and still have those feelings sometimes. We still don’t have an accurate measurement for when it will arrive or effective methods for treating not just the symptoms, but the patient. Generally just rushing to medicate rather than actively listen in this and most medical situations.

Autoimmune diseases still not tested for/overlooked because women perceived as dramatic for experiencing symptoms that often seem different or not easily diagnosed: thyroid, RA, Lupus, Sjogrens, etc.

I’ve read about/known women who were sexually assaulted while under anesthesia for dental or other work by male doctors. As a result I’m personally sometimes uncomfortable with a male doctor.

The idea (even among women) that a C-Section isn’t a “real” labor, even though many women like me labored for 17 hours and had a breech baby or whatever the circumstances were: my (female) obgyn literally said “well if you’re not going to try” with exasperation and made me feel like a failure for not delivering vaginally. This, combined with pressure to breastfeed when I couldn’t caused me a lot of unneeded stress and suffering where I needed support.

The whole idea of “daddy issues” being dismissive of women suffering traumatic relationships with their fathers, and shorthand for shaming women.

And I guess just the idea that we’re always a bitch no matter what when standing up for ourselves, being assertive, you name it: basically anything other than being quiet and not taking up space literally or figuratively. Or at least, it feels that way sometimes.

I could probably keep going but that’s just what came to mind for now.

She actually had a weird phobia of vomit and actually forced herself to make it through 4 pregnancies without vomiting, including one where her uterus ruptured. So she knew something was really wrong and my brother took her to the ER. They tried to explain this to the staff and without any differential they just told her she probably ate something bad and were trying to send her home.

Many conditions like heart attack, autism and ADHD manifest differently between the sexes, and a surprising number of doctors are outdated or even ignorant on diagnostic criteria when it comes to women. 

* Women often cannot display any level of aggravation, aggressiveness, frustration, etc. without it being chalked up to their menstrual cycle. So much so that it's one of the most common jokes about women. When men show dominance or anger, it's usually taken seriously, but when women do it, they're ""PMSing emotional wrecks whose hormones must be all over the place."" Not intended to be a men vs. women thing, it just happens to be a dichotomy that is very much overlooked.

* Some women don't want children, and society simply has not evolved to accept this. It's infuriating to know beyond doubt that you do not want to have children, only to have endless doctors, well-meaning friends, family, even co-workers whose business it absolutely is not tell you that you are going to change your mind, you just haven't accepted your God-given duty in this life or whatever.

* Abortion. Women's bodies are apparently a divisive political issue with entire political parties and movements dedicated to regulating their right to have autonomy over *their own bodies.* It's hard enough being in that situation, yet people constantly seem to think they should get to have an opinion on it. It is so bad that it's unsafe or even impossible in some places to end an unwanted pregnancy. 

* That women are default caretakers. This is one that is severely overlooked since historically, this has been their assigned role. They are expected not only to have children, but to be the consistent caregiver to the child, while also (by necessity) needing to work full time+ while simultaneously running the entire household, (keeping track of appointments, etc.) This is not *always* the case, of course, but as far as societal expectations, it still very much is the norm.

* And finally, one of the most overlooked issues of all...caretaking for elderly relatives. The vast, vast majority of both private and professional caregivers are women. Caretaking for the sick and elderly is a full time job in itself that more and more women are facing alone, in a climate that doesn't even fully support women and their children and definitely doesn't support most types of elder-care. Elder-care is most often unpaid thankless work that women are expected to do for their families, all while struggling with raising children in jobs that often pay far less than their male counterparts."

Snackrattus,h3s4zkw,5,"**The biggest issue? Medicine, both of body and mind.**

Most historical medical studies were done on cisgender white men, and if *any* of those differ, you are less likely to receive tailored (and frequently substandard) care.

Women's opinions about their own bodies (or fields of expertise) aren't taken as seriously in almost any sphere, by both men and other women. But in medicine, this is especially dangerous. They are *assumed* to over-report pain, but are more likely to under-report it. As a result, their given pain management *for the same injuries* is lower, *and* their medical concerns are not taken as seriously. It can take women several tries to find a doctor that will listen to her concerns or run tests.

The most dramatic example *just in my personal sphere* would be a woman with a bowel tumour that weighed *several kilos*, but couldn't convince anybody to investigate or run tests because 'you're just fat', over and over. She's alive, but lost a *lot* of her intestine because it went untreated so long. Her diet has to be strictly controlled for the rest of her live because she couldn't convince anybody at her local practice to listen to her.

Conditions that affect menstrual pain are *especially* hard to convince medical professionals to take seriously. Yes, it is normal to experience tightness, mild cramping, minor bloating, and/or discomfort. It is *not* normal to spend an entire day lying on your bed, white as a sheet and trying not to cry. One common example is endometriosis (when the soft uterine tissue grows *outside* the uterus), but you could even have adenomyosis, where the uterine tissue grows into the *muscle layer* of the uterus - still painful, but much harder to observe with a hysteroscopy."

So last year I felt pain around my left ovary. It was a new and different kind of pain so I guessed it was a ruptured cyst (I have PCOS its more common). I called my GP and they did an abdominal exam, couldn’t identify what the problem was. The GP ran a small blood test to see if I had any inflammation, which I did but still needed to call the hospital to see if I’d need an ultrasound. When the GP came back with “they think your ovary has turned” I thought there has to be some kind of miscommunication because I would definitely feel that. I agreed to go for an ultrasound on the same day. 

The way they treated me was absurd. They acted like I was overreacting and that I was a hypochondriac. I explained the sensation I felt was more likely to be a ruptured cyst and they rolled their eyes at me. Lo and behold they saw my ovary had swollen to 15cm (after bruising my cervix during the ultrasound) and told me to take it easy. Obv I had questions and wanted to understand what happened. The answers I got were curt and dismissive. The gyno implied having sex caused the rupture, which is nowhere near the truth. 

I left that place completely dejected and scared for my life. My ovary is 15cm and they tell me to take it easy? My follow up appointment was much better with an entirely different set of people. And all the people I dealt with were women. All of them. And this is in the Netherlands too. I was so shocked and appalled."

And when I tried to find a new doctor after the third, I was asked, ""Are you sure you had a miscarriage? You probably had a chemical pregnancy. That's more common."" 

Ummm...no. a***hole. I had to have a D&C the first time because the gestational sac kept growing with no baby inside and my health was in danger. Then I was at 10 weeks for miscarriages 2 and 3. I bled out and had to go to the hospital. So, no. I am aware of my own body enough to know the difference between that and ""Oh, I had a faint line and then the next day I got my period.""

I tried to join an online support group, but half the people were judgemental and the other half were celebrating ""rainbow babies.""

I mentioned it to several doctors and gynos and was sympathetically told that’s just life for some girls.

When I was 31, an OBGYN diagnosed me with a dermoid cyst during a pregnancy ultrasound. It was the 4th ultrasound during the pregnancy and I had previously had an one done by a fertility specialist. The specialist commented on how one of my ovaries looked different, but didn’t diagnose it as a problem.

After more than 15 years of unnecessary pain, the problem ovary was removed and everything resolved. No more irregular periods. No more cramps."

About 15%- 30% (according to different sources) of PMDD sufferers will attempt suicide. It is genetic and has been discovered fairly recently. It has not been studied well and, frankly, i dont know if there are many extensive studies in progress.There is no effective treatment that has been developed yet, excluding certain types of birthcontrol like Yaz, that do not work for everyone. For me it made things worse. Some get prescribed SSRIs, antihistamines or CBD treatments which also don't work for everyone and when they do they just partially suppress symptoms, not eliminate them. Biggest problem is that doctors are often not familiar with the disorder, so they diagnose you with bipolar, depression or DONT TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY/ BELEIVE YOU at all. (excuse my caps lock use) It is horrible, isolating and debilitating. I wish to die every month, since the nature of this disorder is genetic...

The first response I got from family: “Why did you propose first? Are you worried he’s going to cheat/leave you? Are you fighting? Are you really sure you want to do this? Was he not *manly enough* to pop the question? What if you change your mind about each other in 10 years?”

NSAID and a muscle relaxer can fix it, and the pain completely disappears with my cycle, so it must not be serious 😒

Also, once a doctor adds depression and anxiety to your file, anything you do is looked at through the anxiety lens.  Someone needs to tell these people that anxiety doesn’t always mean OCD or irrational fears about your health.

Luckily the baby was ok mom had to be sectioned for 72 hours. Cops who arrived on the scene said drugs might be involved, and they were looking to prosecute. They never back tracked their story when it came out the mother having Postpartum psychosis and no drugs in her system. Now the world thinks of her as a monster who wanted to kill her baby.

Someone brought up Andrea Yates who drowned her children. Also suffered from PPP

Another woman in NY recently stood trial over stabbing her infants despite being out of her mind.

Another mother threw her children off a balcony and jumped with them.

A lady where I'm from pushed her dead baby 3 days straight on a swing and was given some punishment despite a surveillance camera capturing her not eating, sleeping or moving from that spot the entire 3 days.

Many times these women are made to look like monsters in the news, but are suffering a psychological break.

Also another problem facing women.

We get a lot of shit, if a mom is struggling it's always ""tough you shouldn't have kids"" but if it's a dad that's struggling...he gets some form of sympathy.

A single mom often gets looks and judgement, a single dad is often praised for being around.

When my ex didn't see our kid for months at a time partying and couch surfing he was never demonized by his family or even mine. I happen to ask my ex MIL to baby sit one day for my birthday to go with my sister and brother in law, and ""why are you going out you need to be with your kids"".

linerys,h3ucm24,4,"**Bra sizing**. It might not be as bad as some of the medical conditions listed here, but it’s very annoying to me because it would be so easy to fix.

Have you ever heard “80% of women are wearing the wrong bra size”? Well, it’s probably true. Most size charts add **4 inches/10 cm** to your underbust. Think about that for a second. Would you wear pants that were 4 inches too big? Not without a belt, right?

Most size charts will tell someone with a 34 inch underbust to wear size 38. In Europe, you’re told to wear size 85 if your measurement is ~85 cm. So Europe’s sizing is correct? Unfortunately not. 85 cm is 33.46 inches. Let’s round up to 34. Size 34 is equivalent of size 75. So in Europe, you need to subtract “10” from your underbust measurement to get your band size. Unfortunately, no size chart will mention that.

A bra is a support garment, meant to do more than just hang loosely around your body like a t-shirt. However, when most people are wearing bands that are too big, you’re not going to get a lot of support.

If almost everyone who wears a bra is in a band that is too big, wouldn’t they notice? Not necessarily. If you don’t know what a good fit should look and feel like, it can be very hard to spot. Plus, when you’re telling someone who should be wearing 34DD that they really need a 38 band, you can’t give them a 38DD. The cups would be too big. So you *decrease the cup size*.

34DD is for someone with a 34 inch underbust and a 5 inch larger bust. Making the bust measurement 39. When you give this person a 38 band, the difference between the band size and bust measurement is just 1 inch. So you give them a 38A. Someone who should be wearing a 34DD is wearing a 38A.

A lot of people really hate bras, and I get why. Wearing the wrong size might give you a band that rides up and needs to be adjusted several times a day. Your shoulder straps might dig into your shoulders, or just slide off no matter how much you tighten them. Your ribcage might hurt because you have a wire digging into it. Your breast are either not filling up the top of the cup *or* spilling out. Or you get none of these, but you’re still uncomfortable. Or maybe you feel fine. It varies a lot from person to person.

tl;dr: Stop adding 4 inches to your underbust. *Start* removing 10 cm if you’re European.

Where can I [get sized by someone who doesn’t add 4 inches](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php)? r/ABraThatFits is open for everyone.

The fact that women in tech are pushed towards managerial positions because they're women and it'll be more sustainable after they get married is trope that I hate hearing. Because no woman should have to hear that she needs to prove her resilience and technical abilities after she is married just to gain sub par respect.

The fact that young girls are taught to accept the patronising language that they are spoken to with since school age is even worse because it's so ingrained in them. Law officials are hard to trust and often times handle you in an incredibly manipulative manner and put you in awkward situations.

As I started passing more I've noticed that I'm heard more, questioned less in medical spaces especially about my health or the meds I need. Law and legal work is easier to deal with and wait times aren't as excruciating. And while I'm thankful it still drives me crazy to know that my friends aren't privy to the same treatment.

When I was around 17-19, I had such debilitating stomach pains literally every time I ate anything.

Made an appointment with my doctor’s office, main doctor was off that week. The medical assistant saw me instead. 

Took one look at me, and said my pain was being caused by me starving myself because I wanted to loose weight since I was so fat (ever since puberty I’ve been on the heavier side. Can’t seem to get rid of it). I explained that wasn’t true, because I was actually comfortable with my body at that point in time, plus I wouldn’t starve myself to try & loose weight. I like food, I wanna eat! But the med assistant wouldn’t run any tests, wouldn’t prescribe any medication to help the pain, just told me to loose weight in a different way, & booted me out of the office.

They wanted me to wait six months for an ultrasound which was ridiculous as I was in and out of hospital for a good month. They did blood tests but only checked for infection nothing more. It turns out I had a cyst that had burst and caused a massive infection in that area because they refused to see me anymore thinking I was being overly dramatic. The problem is that ovarian cysts and cancer have pretty much identical symptoms and having a friend’s sister die of it 3 years before didn’t help my fear. They treated me the same they did her. By the time they found it, it was too late and she died 5 months later. The reason neither of us were checked for cysts or cancer when I even asked for the blood test was because we were under 60 and it was unlikely to be a cyst or cancer."

My wisdom teeth came through while I was on this and they were like plastic, they shattered not long after coming through.

The injection was the best but I would get the usual pain just coming up to the next one, so every 4 months. It wasn't great to look forward to. I would also get huge moods swings at this time and would have to excuse myself from work to cry for absolutely no reason.

I think raising girls like this is doing them a massive disservice, ending up with women that say „I always ride the train without a ticket, and if I get caught I just start crying and get away with it“ is a massive disservice to society because it highly raises the amount of situations we encounter in wich everyone involved seems destined to feel bad about themselves.

They thought I did everything to myself and send me straight to the psychologist after I got out of the hospital (I was 16 years old then). It’s too easy to blame girls for having an eating disorder or whatever. They never really looked into my pain.

Even after collapsing at and putting an airshow on hold to be air-lifted, because of these issues - I was still given the brush off.  
They tried me on a hormone treatment - I put on two stone in just a couple of months & my body still has not recovered from that. I begged and pleaded for someone to give me a hysterectomy or some option to help. Finally, in 2019 my doctor listened and sent me to a gynecologist. She sat and listened to the symptoms & also asked about how I was coping mentally. I explained the issues my Mum also had (and my sisters) and she offered me an ablation (removing of the womb lining) as an option - I actually cried...for the first time someone saw me, saw how I was struggling.   
I actually was seen for my pre-op appointment that day and had my op a couple of months later (just before lock down). I have not had a period since & it's awesome - nobody should go 36 years looking for someone to help and/or listen...no matter the issue.

(Note that I pass no judgement on anyone else's choices here. If you formula fed/feed and everyone is happy, that's amazing and I am glad we have safe infant formula available.) No attempt to actually help me, no attempt to find out how I felt about what I fed my baby, just ""just stop if it's causing problems.""

Then onto the ultrasound tech at the breast clinic who told me, I kid you not, that she couldn't tell what was up because my breast was too full of milk - that was the reason I was there, I had a blockage and we were trying to see if it was a clogged duct, mastitis or an abscess. (Spoiler, it was none of those things but an infected Montgomery gland, the only person who knew what they were talking about was a postnatal ward midwife.)

And then we wonder why breastfeeding rates here are abysmal.

(I hasten to add that I ignored all the bad advice, took the antibiotics that were offered and proceeded to breastfeed perfectly fine for the next 10 months. We are still going.

I wasn’t even given diagnostic testing for something I’d shown symptoms of until 6 years after first showing symptoms. At least 5 doctors dismissed me or told me birth control was my only option (despite knowing it wasn’t and also knowing that I can’t take most hormonal birth control due to severe side effects) and it wasn’t until I was over 200 pounds from being incapable of walking due to pain for three weeks out of every four that a doctor was finally like “I guess we can check for this thing you started showing symptoms of 6 years ago” and was able to diagnose me beyond a shadow of a doubt. Another time (though much shorter) I was having increasingly bad pain near one of my lungs. I was really concerned and it was a very unique sort of pain so I kept going back to the doctor for it but my usual doctor was pretty busy so I kept getting sent to a guy that’s basically her backup. After five months of being told to pee in a cup every time I went and learning nothing I finally refused to be seen by him and said I’d wait as long as I needed to for an appointment with my usual doctor and she was able to diagnose me and refer me to a specialist in one visit. She is one of two doctors who have ever listened to me, the other being my pediatric neurologist.

Um no, their heart isn’t getting enough oxygen and they need a specialized test to look at their microcirculation and they should be put on heart meds.

This happened to my mom, but she had an AMAZING doctor who took her seriously and basically forced her to get a special test done.

Got a referral to a pulmonologist who said I have asthma and nothing else. Rinsed and repeat with a handful of other doctors.

A good friend of mine is a PA and just thought based on me describing my symptoms that I might have pectus excavatum, a condition where the sternum is caved in and puts pressure on the lungs, and is severely under diagnosed in women because breast tissue hides the appearance. Doesn't show up well on x-rays. She thought so because she herself has pectus excavatum and went through the same shit. My pulmonologist literally only looked at my lung capacity. I even brought it up and they said ""I can tell by your shirt that you don't have it."" Never even properly examined me.

It took me seeing a (female) cardiothoracic surgeon specializing in chest wall disorders who ordered a chest CT to get a proper diagnosis. She referred me to a (female) cardiologist who has worked with this before. Let's be clear- the ONLY reason I ended up getting a proper diagnosis is because a (female) friend of mine who was also misdiagnosed for years got pissed off enough about it to become a pulmonary PA and diagnosed me *over text* in another state.

I had 7 different doctors tell me it was stress or anxiety. My heart and lungs are literally being compressed by my sternum but okay yes it's just me being dramatic.

Lurvehue89,h3skdcp,3,"When I was 12, my primary doctor said I must have appendicitis. Was sent to the hospital right away where they wound up saying it was nothing, maybe a small intestine issue. My parents had to go away for the weekend after, so I stayed with my grandparents. They were pissed that I had been sent home but kept giving me the paracetamol that I had been told to take. Monday morning I was comatose and my parents skipped my primary doc and drove straight to the ER. I was still overlooked for 8 hours and did end up in a coma. I had all the markers for sepsis, and by the eight hour my parents just grabbed the first doctor they saw and forced him to check on me as I was unresponsive. Mind you, they had tried the whole day too. Straight up to surgery after that. In my charts from the surgery they wrote that when they opened me up, my insides were dark green and smelled so rotten that one of the nurses left the room to puke! I was in septic shock and the infections had spread all the way around my system, with only the heart not directly affected but struggling. I needed several tubes to drain various organs and spent a month in hospital. Also mentioned several times in my charts is how angry my parents were and how they screamed at everyone who had ignored me and not listened. I lost around six months of school as my body was so weak after that ordeal. I was so tiny that I used clothes for 8 years olds at the age of 12 and 13. It was really bad for a long time. 

To top it off, I never really got any better. In fact, each year that went by after that, I seemed to get new weird symptomes. Ranging everywhere from pain in various places, to me getting violent seizures. At age 18 I had my first bleeding ulcer from being over-medicated with stuff that should not have been taken together. At age 20 I had my first blood transfusion out of many. No idea where my blood went, cause I wasnt bleeding anywhere. Only my primary doctor believed something was very wrong. I lost a lot of weight, had violent seizures, needed blood transfusions very randomly. Could test high blood levels in the morning and needing transfusions in the evening and other times it could be a couple weeks before I needed them. By the time I was taken seriously by the hospital, I was a walking skeleton. Weighed 36 kilos and was 158cm tall, my skin was greenish blue, my hair was dried and frizzy, and was thinning out. My doc actually blurted out one day ""wow, I have only seen that skin color on week old dead people!"" And then she realized she said it out loud and apologized while I basically laughed my ass off. I still think it was hilarious. Eventually tests found two golf ball sized lymph nodes in my abdomen and I was sent to the cancer hospital in the capitol. Turns out these two golf balls were full of all the old appendicitis stuff and they had been eating me from the inside. They absorbed my blood, my muscle mass, vitamin and mineral levels, everything. A few more days and I would not have lived as my body wouldnt have been able to withstand the surgery. 

After that surgery, all the blood tests stabilized really fast. But I never really got my old self back cause the infections had ravaged my body so much and it was also discovered I have Ehlers Danlos syndrome, which was also very much affected for the worse with all this shit. But after many years of physical therapy and rehab stays, I now have a life I love. Permanently disabled, but happy."

Infamous_Suspect_44,h3svaxk,3,"Oh man, I know I'm a little late to this post but there are so many things. 

1. Hyperemesis Gravidarum aka severe morning sickness which happens in about 5% of pregnancies. Not only do people not know that this condition exists, they don't understand the severity of it and how it basically is detrimental to your health and your ability to function. The vomiting can be so bad that you have to go to the emergency room to get an IV place so you don't die of dehydration, and if it doesn't get to be that severe it basically just makes having to do your daily life impossible because you don't know when you will just be vomiting uncontrollably for months on end. It is the most torturous thing I've ever experienced and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Far worse than any physical pain I've ever experienced but people treated it like it was just some casual nausea and I should just get over it and be happy that I was pregnant. 

2. Everything is a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation in society especially when it comes to women's sexuality or role pertaining to motherhood. If you're sexually active before marriage you're considered a slut but if you wait until you get serious in a relationship you're prude. If you decide to have children and become a stay-at-home mom then you're just a mombie who is obsessed with her kids but if you decide to go back to work, you're selfish and doing your kids a disservice. If you put an effort into your appearance you're just doing what the patriarchy or the media tells you to do, if you don't put in any effort or dressed in an unconventional way, you're ugly or gross or weird. 

3. I don't I think the average heterosexual man under stands what it's like to be a woman out in public, especially if you are decent looking and under the age of 50 or so. Imagine living in a world where about 80 to 90% of the men around you would willingly sleep with you and look at you in a sexual manner. And on top of that about 10% of those men would be willing to resort to violent means to sleep with you. And then on top of that, imagine you are one third the size of most of those men around you. It's pretty unnerving. I implore the straight men reading this that the next time you go to a place like the grocery store or a hardware store, imagine that almost every guy you walk by is checking you out and 1 out of 10 of those men could be violent. That what it's like to be a woman for the most part."

As a man, you might walk down the street and hope no one messes with you and wants to fight...as a woman, you worry that someone doesn't rape you.  It is so common and terrifying.  

It also makes me wonder if this many people are raped or sexually assaulted - what is the percentage of men who rape or sexually assault? It can't be as small as we hope. If that percentage of women are raped, a much bigger percentage of our male friends and acquaintances are rapists.

jenjudges,h3uwonn,3,"Speaking from personal experience in the UK; PCOS and diagnosing it. I had missing periods for 20+ YEARS. I went to various doctors (different genders), had blood tests and ultrasounds to be told everything was normal. I went to the GP about a query about my thyroid as I was watching a YouTuber talk about their hashimotos disease and a lot of things sounded really familiar. They listened, agreed to test my thyroid and once again, this came back normal. 

They asked if I'd been tested for PCOS. I had but apparently not all of the tests. The tests are they test your progesterone and oestrogen levels, then do an ultrasound. This was as far as all the previous GPs had done. The missing test was to measure testosterone levels. They were high. Like super high. The treatment I have is a simple pill usually used to treat diabetes twice a day. 

To be diagnosed with PCOS (again in the UK) you need two of the three symptoms: missing periods, cysts on your ovaries, high testosterone. 

PCOS can cause a whole fuckton of issues which are usually dismissed as women's issues, anger issues/past trauma, being overweight, unhealthy diet, eating disorders, etc etc. Some doctors really need pushing to get diagnosed. My male GP was an absolute Saint about it all. He did not mess about and got me diagnosed and starting treatment within 2 weeks. I now have vaguely regular periods, I'm on the waiting list to see a gynaecologist, my anger has lessened, and I'm losing weight."

Just now, over on Imgur, there's a [soccer clip where it zooms in on her wet ass as she gets up off the ground.](https://imgur.com/gallery/3YyR6bA) (Post has since been removed)

Weeks ago I was watching some running qualifier thing, I wasn't really paying attention, but after they interviewed the female runner, the camera stayed on her as she walked away, while the commentators kept talking about the game. For eight extra seconds of footage. She was of course wearing a sporty outfit, as you'd expect.

BUT, after they interviewed a male runner, the camera cuts as soon as he turns around to walk away. They wasted NO time.

They kept the camera on her ass as she walked away.

Do you think men are watching women's volleyball because they're fans of the sport? Why aren't they watching men's volleyball? Because they're not entertained by guys in speedos.

They make it sound so great, that all these female leagues are so popular, but they're not popular for the right reasons. They're popular because of their bodies, and not their talent, and that disappoints me.

WHY is it so hard to treat women, hell, EVERYONE, with respect? Do you think a female camera operator would follow her ass for that long, or would she rightfully bring up concerns?

It's ridiculous, and I'm so disgusted to be grouped in with the rest of the men. Of course my ooga booga caveman brain says Yay Ass! but just a second later, it realizes the unfairness of it, and I'm disgusted with myself for enjoying it. But sadly, I don't see that changing anytime soon."

Heart attack symptoms that you’ve most likely heard a lot about are more likely to happen in men than women. Men and women are told, “you will probably have arm pain instead of chest pain”, when it’s actually the other way round for women. 

Women are more likely to die in car accidents. Crash test dummies are usually the average size of an adult male. 

Many clinical trials for medication that would be used on both sexes or even (believe it or not) only women, had exclusively male test subjects. A common excuse is that “periods may affect the results”. If that was true, isn’t that a bigger reason to test the drugs on women (since the make up HALF the human population)?

Period products are considered to be “luxuries” rather than necessities in many countries. I live in Scotland, and we are the first country to make period products free. This happened only recently. How sad is that? Countless women across the world are too poor to afford period products, then get shamed for bleeding through their clothes. Also, there is an enormous amount of stigma over something that is as normal and no more disgusting than peeing or pooing. Lots of women are afraid to speak up if they are in pain or experiencing very irregular periods.

In general, our physical pain is often dismissed. So many women with endometriosis or similar conditions say that it took them YEARS to get a diagnosis. Some people think that women’s pain is inevitable (these people are also the types to deny what a woman is going through, but that’s worthy of a separate discussion), so we should just suck it up and shut up. A 2001 study, (I hope things have improved between then and now, but I doubt it) showed that men in pain are more likely to be given painkillers, while women in pain are more likely to be given sedatives or antidepressants."

Cysts on the ovaries.

I had one ruptured and just so happened to be in the ER with my coworker that I drove due to her having heart problems.

I thought I was going to fucking die, but the male er doctor kept doing vaginal exams and used a transvaginal ultrasound wand. The pain was worst than child birth and unberable! I had to scream and curse him out til his nurse told him I was in pain and I needed an actual ultrasound.

He reluctantly sent me to the ultrasound tech.

I took a screenshot of it on my phone of the scans he captured and showed it to the tech (whom was a woman). She asked if she could borrow my phone and show her supervisor. 

Turns out, this man confused my uterus with  my ovaries...I wish I was joking.

I'm a black female, the tech was also black, but the er doc was white...

The tech was upset at what happened to the point her supervisor got involved and phoned the er. She told me that the cyst that ruptured was pretty big and that I had a few more, but they were tiny compared to the ruptured one. In short, she said it's possible things could have gone south. They both couldn't stop apologizing, but hammered that I needed to report the treatment.

The final result was giving me ibuprofen and the er doc sent me on the way...

I was still in pain.

As soon as I could, I reached out to patient advocate and told them what happened...

A day later, I was back in the same er and was met with the patient advocate manager, a woman. She had a woman er doc and a woman nurse that took care of me. The rupture was so bad, they admitted me, gave me morphine, ran tests, and put me under observation for 8 hrs. I had an appointment with a obgyn specialist a week later where I got more care.

As for the er doc, I do know he got in trouble and I heard he got suspended for the behavior. I don't know if he's back.

A year ago I broke my leg in 3 places.  It was compressed into a half cast - after an xray showed a butterflied fibula and my medial malleolus (the pointy knobbly bits on your ankles) completely broken off - WITH NO PAIN RELIEF.

I was overlooked for promotion for those 4 years despite the fact that i was overqualified for the position they hired me for and at that point knew just as much as the people above me. I always had to fight to receive training because the management team actively tried to prevent me from learning, and then would turn around and try to list not knowing enough about our systems as a reason they wouldnt promote me. As much as i was overlooked for my technical know how, was compensated for with praise for all the ""feminine"" things I did like being kind and creative, and boosting team moral. (Side note, I'm not sure if the men in my department would ever be praised for these things no matter how kind or creative they were, which is part of the same issue.)

It also makes them more vulnerable to disease, since they have to use dirty cloth and other unsanitary options or not change their products often enough.

I was having to change my pads/tampons sometimes once an hour (which, any woman will tell you, is excessive).  I went to doctors about this over and over again, and it was always brushed off -- 'periods are hard, women suffer, so you know, just put up with it'.  More often than not, it was chalked up to some mental/emotional issue.  There would be talks of ""are you stressed?  Is there anything going on in your life that could be causing you undo pressure that is affecting your cycle?""  


And like, a question like 'are you stressed"" to a working adult who has come to the doctor for a medical issue -- I would sit there and go ""I guess? I mean, I'm stressed sometimes.  I'm definitely stressed when I'm on my period and I'm afraid of leaking all over the damn place.""    


I travelled to Asia and ended up in the hospital due to a severe case of the food poisoning, and while I was there they found fibroids in my uterus -- one of which was as big as a watermelon, and was actually visible from the outside because I was so dehydrated from all the loss of fluids.  Like, you could see it protruding from my stomach.  I looked up the symptoms of fibroids after being told this is what I had, and literally everything I had ever said to a doctor was on that list.

But why is it any different than mentioning you had to be out for surgery or some other medical procedure? 

And you can’t tell anyone about the heavy emotional pain and darkness that it has put you in afterwards, for weeks or months, because it is super awkward and makes people visibly uncomfortable. Maybe it’s not a death per se (at least earlier on in pregnancy) but it can definitely feel like one, or at least the death of a hope. It’s incredibly isolating to feel so alone and muted when you’re going through something like that. 

I’m not really sure why it’s such a taboo topic. People love talking about pregnancy.

After surgery, the pathology report came back with severe Adenomyosis, and no wonder I had been in pain for so many years.

I started having painful and heavy periods just after a year of starting my period. I was 11 at the time of my first one so I was 12 when they became painful. 
I would miss school monthly because I was in so much pain. 
Fast forward a few years and I’m now 15; I find out about endometriosis. It makes sense (to me) because I have tried so many different types of birth control and the usual over the counter pain meds (my old family doctor even put me on 1300 mg (or so) of ibuprofen 3 times a day). I would bring this issue and endometriosis with the many OBGYNs I’ve seen and they all said one of these two things: 
1. I’m way to young to have endometriosis (this was a favorite) 
2. Go see a GI doctor. This isn’t female related.

So I finally see a new doctor who will be putting an IUD in for me to try as it’s the last form of birth control I haven’t tried (besides the implant in the arm). Since I was only 16 then and not sexually active, they were going to put me under. During the pre op, she asked some questions about my cycle. She said she thought I had endometriosis and since I was going to be out if it was okay if she went in and looked for it. I didn’t even have to tell her my concerns.. she just knew.
Fast forward to the procedure, she found a good amount of endometriosis behind my uterus, some behind my left ovary, and some near my urethra. Now I’m almost 18 and I am on the last option of treatment before a hysterectomy is discussed. I have a genetic disorder that I don’t want to pass on so it wouldn’t be that difficult of a decision (hopefully), but it hasn’t come to that yet. And there’s still hope.

The only reason I haven't been assaulted yet is because I stay home normally and try not to put myself in weird positions by going out of my way to avoid anything most people my age consider fun. It's stressful."

Thats nowhere close to being a unique experience, theres countless psychiatrists, crisis teams, doctors, teachers, therapists, relatives, and everyone under the sun tbh, all telling me i was just a hormonal teenager even though my mental illnesses started before puberty. Ive had probably around 100 unalive attempts because no one listened, they were too busy telling me that i wasnt mentally ill and it was just hormones. Now im nearly 21 and diagnosed with bpd and am disabled because surprise surprise, i was mentally ill. 
People dont listen to teenage girls, professional healthcare providers dismiss them and the people that are meant to care for them simply dont. Listen to people no matter their age because it doesnt matter what the source of the pain is, it doesnt help to ignore it.

It's ridiculous that you can put your entire life at risk and your health at risk to give birth when you're 18 and younger and no one bats an eye, but you can't do a much less invasive procedure than birth, that is sterilization at 18. It's absurd.

MotivatedLikeOtho,h3s2lbr,0,"Disclaimer - I'm a dude and got this from my ex, so if any women disagree then listen to them not me, but...

Period pain is not an acceptable human experience, it is not natural (on the level it is experienced by women today) and should be considered a serious medical issue which needs solving.

At the time humanity evolved, as I understand it, women would almost always be in one of three states - juvenile, menopausal, or, pregnant. That's the situation of prototype human societies without birth control or women's rights. TLDR we arent supposed to experience that level of pain so regularly.

Obviously society today knows that that isnt the best or the right way for 50% of the human population to have to exist, and it's good that bodily autonomy and equality has developed. But that doesnt mean period pain should be left as a thing weve just got to accept - it's a product of our advanced societies we must solve.

There are two main reasons, one being that, as I said, it's a product of greater autonomy and modernity for women that its experienced more, so it's sort of seen as a binary - it's better than being breeding stock, so to speak. Which isnt really a glowing review. The second is that the medical research and management fields have until recently been almost exclusively male-dominated, and men would A) dont know about, and B) dont care about, women's health."

Few women have that kind of physique and risk injury doing that kind of work.  So the bar for men to good wages is much lower, where as women need college.

frolicking_elephants,h3s3w8r,-12,"The way institutions that supposedly favor us are wielded as weapons against feminism. A good example is alimony. People always talk about how unfair alimony is to men. Take the example of a man with a good job married to a woman who has, say, an associate's degree in communications. They're married for fifteen years, have three kids, and then get a divorce. The alimony for the wife is way more than she could expect to make with her associate's degree. Really unfair, right? Why should she be entitled to his money?

What people don't see is that she gave up her plans to go and get a bachelor's degree after she got pregnant. With a baby at home, she could no longer work full-time, and had to get a job with a more flexible schedule but much less pay. Because of this, she was naturally the one to take the kids to doctors appointments and chaperone field trips as they grew older, because it was harder for her husband to take time off of his traditional 9-5 job. She repeated this with each additional child, and because of her flexible schedule, she was also the one to manage the household, including not just cooking and cleaning but managing the finances, scheduling appointments, making phone calls, etc. She kept this role even after the kids didn't need her at home anymore, because that work still needed to get done and her husband showed no interest in helping with it. His work day is very defined and regular; hers was more flexible but never ends.

Her last pregnancy is fairly brutal - tearing, prolapse, and weird new dietary sensitivities that never go away.

So then when they divorce, she gets primary custody of the kids because she's the main caretaker. He loves them and wants to spend time with them, but he hasn't done the actual hard work of parenting - taking them to soccer games, scheduling their dentist appointments, keeping track of their medical issues - since they were babies, plus his schedule is too rigid for emergencies. So he gets weekends. It's not contentious, but he's not happy.

Meanwhile, with primary custody, she keeps the house, because the space is needed for the kids. With only one income now, she has to figure out how to afford groceries, clothes, school supplies, AND mortgage payments. Plus now she's not on her husband's insurance anymore and her part-time job doesn't offer benefits. She now has to find a good job that will let her pay all of that but allow the flexibility she needs to continue to care for the children and household.

But it's very hard for her to find a job that satisfies those criteria. She's only got an associate's. She hasn't worked full-time in fifteen years. Her schedule is unreliable, and interviewers judge her for being a single mom. The alimony takes into account that she made sacrifices for the marriage her husband did not: her education, her career, even her physical health. If she had actually stayed at home 24/7 to raise the kids, god forbid, she would have been out of the workforce for 15 years and then it would be nearly impossible to get a good job. Now think about how much money she'd be making if she went back to college and hadn't had to raise three kids. *That* is the gap alimony is designed to address. But I hear people use it as an example of how coddled women are all the time."

There can be emotional changes, oseoporosis, disruption of sleep, cardiovascular changes and urinary issues as well.   Its like the world understands menopause but then thinks that it ends there.  After ""the change"" women continue living in this altered state for years but there seems to be very little interest in understanding post menopause.

The hormone patches are freakishly expensive and no generics exist for them.  Doctors tend to just tell women that ""that's what happens with menopause"" and expect us to live like this.  Meanwhile I feel that a better quality of life should be possible if anyone took and interest.  

I am fairly certain that if it was normal for a man's penis to fall off in his 50's we would have a million ways to help with that.  Meds, prosthetics, problem specific counseling etc because ""OMG that is his MANHOOD"" but for women going through a radical change in how our bodies work , ""meh, its menopause women have been doing it forever, you will be OK."""

He proceeded to ask if my stomach got upset when it was “my time of the month” and said I was only having stomach issues because my periods were irregular (I’m on continuous birth control). Dumbass, I’ve had these issues with my stomach since I was 5. He also told me I should snack less even though I had a BMI of 17. Imagine telling someone with an eating disorder to eat less. I was later diagnosed with a handful of food sensitivities/mild allergies and delayed stomach emptying. He dismissed me completely and made me suffer for longer. All because I was a girl."

I guess it comes down to misogyny and sexism and sex education among other things, but specifically in how that plays out with women and their sexuality. The disconnection with and not prioritising their pleasure, not knowing what they enjoy and being unable to communicate it or ask for it, disgust and revulsion with their own vagina and its taste/smell to the point they're uncomfortable with their partners going down on them (recently learned feminine hygiene products neutralise your smell. WHYYYY), taking it as par-for-the-course when their heterosexual/penetrative sex is painful or not satisfying. This is conjecture, and I know there are other reasons, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of these things contribute to why their desire for sex might die down once relationships settle.

Of course, this is super contextual on where you live, who you were brought up or surrounded by. And thankfully for many it tends to resolve when we get older and wiser, and perhaps it's less of an issue for the upcoming generation. But still, I believe so many women are held back by this shit and waste many years of their lives not enjoying this side of life to its full potential."

Four or five years later I went to a new doctor to look into getting a hysterectomy instead of living with this pain that would randomly bring me to my knees every month, and she was able to immediately suggest hormonal oral birth controls or an implanted birth control because what caused the issue was most likely a hormonal imbalance. The IUD has worked like a charm and I have only had occasional discomfort from them since I've had it, but I had to suffer from 12-17 being told that it was normal for periods to hurt and then from 17-21/22 being told that my period was causing me unusual pain so I should take some ibuprofen."

My first thought was appendicitis or something. Or some kind of ileus or whatever. I am a nurse in training so I checked all the shit I could check. But no fever, abdomen soft etc. Still, the pain got worse and worse until I was just sitting on the floor and crying. Also, painkillers hardly worked, which made me a little nervous.

NiamhHA,h3t0pfv,1,"There are some side affects of periods that aren’t talked about very often (even though NONE of them get taken as seriously as the should be). 

Usually, I get terrible nausea on the first day of my period. It doesn’t happen every month, but it does on most months. The nausea is several times worse than any other sickness I’ve ever felt. As soon as I start my period, I’ll take ibuprofen and paracetamol, then dread what will happen in the next few hours. I feel mild cramps at first. Within an hour, I’ll be lying on my bed or sitting in my bathroom, feeling very intense nausea. You know that horrible feeling you get the second before you throw up. It’s like that but it lasts for several hours. It forces me to stop anything I’m doing. Want to watch a TV show? Sorry, you won’t be able to concentrate on or enjoy anything for 2-4 hours. Need to study for an important test tomorrow? Sorry, you’ll need to wake up early in the morning to study instead. A little over a year ago, my worst experience with this happened. I spent ages sitting in my bathroom while my body was practically torturing me. For the rest of the day, I was in shock of what had happened and the dark thoughts I had during it. Weirdly, the remaining days of my period are always fine. Only the first day is day. 

The people I’ve told assume that it’s just cramps, but it’s not. I get pretty bad cramps on the months where it doesn’t happen, and I would 100% take that over the nausea. I’m 17 btw, and I got my period when I was 11. This has been happening since I was around 13 and it’s not been as bad for the past year."

I wanted my tubes tied.

It took me twenty years to get to a gynecologist, every time I asked a doctor, they kept on telling me that I was young, that it wad different when I had my own, and that if I ever had someone, they might want children. And since I wasn’t married, I didn’t have to get it done .

T-Flexercise,h3t1ypj,1,"Any issue that predominantly affects fat women.

I'm 90% sure I have lipedema, a genetic condition in which inflammation causes fibrosis in the fat tissue, which results in nodular, painful, metabolically inactive fat on the arms and legs.  It's a progressive condition which if left untreated can cause debilitating pain, disfigurement, and loss of mobility, does not respond to diet and exercise, and is thought to affect 6-8% of women to at least some degree.

Most doctors do not know what it is.

If you look online, you'll find this small group of endocrinologists, lymphatic specialists, and fat disorder researchers who've been putting out quality research into it since 1940.  There's no doctors who are presenting dissenting opinions on this research.  There's vigorous debate into whether or not it's progressive, whether it must cause pain to be qualified as lipedema, whether it's a condition of the fat or the lymphatics or the connective tissue and all the typical debate doctors have about medical conditions.  But there's nobody out there researching it who is saying ""Nah maybe they're just fat.""

But for myself, like most women with the symptoms of this condition, the only thing I've ever been diagnosed with is ""obesity"".

I ask my doctors about it, and they don't say ""I don't think lipedema is real"" and they don't say ""I don't think you have it"".  They say ""Well what I do know about obesity is that it's about calories in vs calories out!  Let's get you to an endocrinologist for some diet pills!""

I say ""Do you want to feel the fat in my arm?  You can tell, it's full of nodules, it's not smooth like normal fat"" and she says ""No thanks, that's ok.""

I say ""Please help me, I've been on a 1200 calorie ketogenic intermittent fasting diet for the past 6 months, and I've been maintaining a 200 lb bodyweight"" to 4 different doctors, and they don't say ""That's not normal!"" and they don't say ""I think you're mistaken about how much you're eating"".  They say ""Well, it's a marathon, not a sprint!  Keep up the good work!""

People act as if medical discrimination against fat people is just about fat people who don't want to talk about their weight in doctor's appointments.  But it's also about doctors not wanting to talk about fat, or look at fat, or determine ""is this fat healthy metabolic fat, or is there a problem with this fat""?  It's about this idea that not only is a patient's bodyweight a medical issue, but that the doctor's responsibility for treating that medical issue begins and ends with telling a patient that they're fat.  I'm going into doctor's appointments begging to talk about my fat, and my doctor firmly wants to believe that it's not her problem.  She very nicely calls it water weight, and says ""let's talk about your hormonal problems"" and then sends me out the door with a paper that says ""referral to endocrinologist for obesity"" and then I get to repeat the whole thing over with the endocrinologist."

Flayrah4Life,h3t3jwi,1,"Undiagnosed ADHD.

I wasn't diagnosed until 2 weeks shy of my 37th birthday this year.

Do you know how deeply I've absorbed other people's frustrations with my very existence?

Do you know how shocking it is to realize that I'm *not* in fact lazy, immature, silly, selfish, scatterbrained, incompetent, careless, just TOO MUCH . . . that instead my brain physiologically is lacking chemicals and needs a boost to reach the baseline the neurotypicals enjoy? 

Do you know the depth of my relief and rage that my life could have been so very different if meds and therapy had been addressed earlier? If I didn't get punished for forgetting and losing and daydreaming and failing? If coworkers and management understood how to best utilize my skills and tendencies instead of viewing me largely as an incorrigible weirdo?

When I was in elementary in the 90s, ADHD was a hyperactive ""boy"" thing and Ritalin jokes abounded. Yet little girls like me who were too distracted to follow instructions, pay attention, be timely, get lost in daydreaming and who struggled to connect with others socially were brushed off as ""not living up to her potential"" and ""just needs to focus more"" and ""try harder"". Literally every semester review told my parents that these failings were consistent, and yet all the adults in my life insisted it was more of a failure of character than anything.

It's a rough, rough place to be in.

At 37 I live much the same as I did as a teenager: planning ahead for things like meal prep, paying bills, etc. just doesn't happen for me, even with notebooks and physical and digital calendars. I've had nearly 2 dozen jobs since the age of 16, all of them with exception of my newest in the sub-$30,000 range. I have the DESIRE to do wonderful things and I love to learn, implement and share, but my brain just gets in the way of how great and productive I know I could be. And now I have 2 little kids and my symptoms are the worst they've ever been, and I'm desperately trying medication and counseling and trying to build a better life for us so that we don't live in poverty forever. 

Ignoring mental health in women, particularly neurodivergent aspects, is one of the single biggest failings of modern medicine, IMO. The stories alone are overwhelming . . . the knowledge that this wall must be scaled and torn down, even more."

She never explained shit, only that I'm a woman now and that I should jump down the height of 3 steps so that my period would only be 3 days (folktale). Taught me how to put a napkin on my underwear and that's it. She told me to do another folktale, wipe your first period blood on your face to reduce pimples. I said no way.

TW: Sexual assult, torture paedophilia, homelessness and domestic violence. 

All over this planet women are being forced into prostitution and girls as young as seven are being married off to fourty year old men and actually dying on their wedding night. 

There is also an endemic, in Australia and, practically, world wide of homelessness amoungst women who could't add to their super because they were hard at work raising children. (Not easy! 24/7)

Then, there are sickos everywhere, who are sexually assulting, tortureing and murdering women way more than they do men. Then, if it ever goes to court (unlikely) and the woman doesn't have her facts 100% straight 100% of the time, having just been through an extremely traumatic, life changing ordeal things can go downhill fast. Suddenly, legally, socially and emotionally; her efforts ruined. These ordeals also cause significant damage to the brain. 

In order for her to even make an attempt at laying charges, she is forced to relive her trauma in front of lots of people. Let's, also, not forget that eposodic memories (the memories of things that happened) can play tricks on people, especially after a traumatic event. 

In order to get, any kind of, justce, even if it turns out to be a mirage, she is now forced to recite her trauma to a bunch of strangers while being subjected to cruel cross examinations. Highly trained and skilled prosecutores, who've studied for years and years to trip people up on the stand, cross examime the victim to try discredit her and make her out to be a liar. 

So if she loses her credibility, she gets pushed into to pleading guilty and because of that she's is suddenly considered a dirty, rotten liar! This, also, makes her efforts futile and now she's in trouble. He's off the hook and she has to suffer. All the while knowing she won't get any justice. 

And guess what people seem to be most worried about?

WAP by Cardi B. Why? Because,  the women in that song don't repress their sexual urges... at all. I think women are often expected to do that by men. These singers say, openly, what they want and there's nothing wrong with any of it as long as it's consentual.

People get offended by music or the arts. They get offended by stupid jokes. They get offended over frigging cheese. It makes me so angry because people just dont have their priorities straight. It's a running theme of media and lady blaming. A perfect example of this is when Maralyn Manson got blamed for the Columbine shootings just because of his music/image.

It wasn't Manson. Those kids were being bullied. So I think it's time to stop blaming the media for our youth's instabilities. It's people. People kill people. It can be with a gun, or with teasing and bullying. 

Also, the kind of petty bullshit some feminists will go on about, like putting a y in the word woman. Or being offended all the time. It must be tiring to argue with every ignoramus who doesnt have the storage in his brain to take on their, often outrageous, claims, and the greedom of speach thing. Geez! They're making us all look soft.

Then you have these men's groups that contain posts vilifying women. They also claim that feminism is oppressive to their gender. Yes. The gender mostly ruling the earth at the moment. The earth, a planet with nuclear weapons pointed. The gender who's members include a leader, who put a tax on feminine hygene products  but not toilet paper. Calling them ""Luxury items."" 

Yes. It took me a while to get to the point, but yeah. That's basically it. We're all focusing on the wrong stuff first. Also, men should know we can take a joke and, instead of wasting energy worrying about excessive armpit hair and someone's opinion about the evil meat industry when their smoking a frigging darri!"

Pavorleone,h3tttts,1,"A lot of complaints here seem to come from doctors ignoring women's medical issues/pain. And although that is 100% true also in my experience with my wife, I just wanted to add that modern medicine in general just sucks in terms of improving your overall quality of life.
Are you dying of something? It will absolutely save your life.
Do you have cronic pain or symptoms that are mild or painless and don't immediately provide a direct diagnosis? Good luck in your next reencarnation.

My grandfather went to the hospital everyday for a week complaining of leg pain, they said it was nothing until he lost his leg. 
I had skin problems and went to several doctors over several months. It was stress, then alergies (I don't have alergies). Finally, after months of ignoring me and not going through the trouble of analysing my skin a specialist found it was a fungus. The alergies medicine was actually making it worse (which was obvious).
My mother had a similar situation with respiratory problems, it was just stress they said, after a year of going to several doctors she was finally taken seriously and needed surgery.
This was across different hospital in different cities and countries. I have many friends with similar stories. It seems to me that [EDIT: on top of the obvious anti women discrimination] modern medicine is more reactive than preventive and they will often just ignore symptoms if they are deemed light enough."

Instead of talking about thing like in this thread , they focus on only  scratching the surface , ultimately guilt tripping men by pointing the obvious .

By this i’m not saying that men are victims of society , and that they don’t need to change a couple of aspects of there behavior. but that everyone in this “equality talks “ seems  to only address the most obvious of problems ending in pretty and simplistic quotes like “do not harm women “ “ when a women says no is no””listen men you have to respect your girlfriend “ which results in me and my friends thinking  “ of course that I know that I’m fucking 18 years old and that’s some kindergarten shit “

In the end  what I want to say with this post is that this thread has help me understand a shit ton of problems that a women have to face on a daily basis , not by guilt tripping me into thinking that everything that I do is with a bad intention and to fear women , but by pointing out problems that escape a “be more empathic” and require more complicated measures ( like laws or more specialized classes about sex Ed and women anathomy in general )"

A fancy meal might be a drop in the bucket to a guy making a lot of money, and it might mean not being able to afford rent because you ordered a salad for a woman with the same job.

There are statistics, but there isn’t much awareness or adjustment of care for girls or women who did not receive care or whose bodies were someone else’s playground. Women who were sexually abused as children are more likely to die early. We are more likely to have unexplained pelvic pain. We are less likely to go to appointments for pelvic exams. Some of us suffer re-traumatization when getting examined, so we avoid appointments. 

I personally haven’t known when to go to doctors or emergency rooms, or I know something is wrong but I put off dealing with the problem. I could still use some help with what to do and say at the doctors. I’m old now and I read and watch many videos. I think I’ve had symptoms which require medical intervention.

I apparently had pre-existing genetics that put me at a higher risk for clots than normal, but when I was first put on the pill it was a quick passing phrase of “higher risk of clots but no worries”. 

It was a huge worry. Because of the DVT I can never be on any type of hormonal birth control. The only non-hormonal option (besides condoms) is the copper IUD, which has its own slew of side effects."

PearsonRookie325,h41fl3w,1,"Many of the forms of oppression that specifically or especially face Women of Color are overlooked in the overall ""feminist"" tradition, which is why we have the term ""white feminism"". Essentially, white feminist dismisses WOC's issues as just being race issues and therefore having no place in feminism. Many of the people subscribing to white feminist ideals don't realize that they are doing this. It isn't an accusation. It's just something a lot of people don't understand, and you have to understand it and question it in order to improve it.

Here's an example: Black women's hair is so controversial, and why? Many feminists may not even know that Black women face discrimination based on their hair, because it's hard to notice that if you, yourself, haven't been through it. But it's very prevalent. This is an example: [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swimming-cap-natural-hair-banned-tokyo-olympic-games-fina/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swimming-cap-natural-hair-banned-tokyo-olympic-games-fina/)See, Black women have been saying FOREVER that we have different hair needs from non-Black people. (And the hair needs apply to all Black people, not just women, but it is Black women who are most often caught in conversations like this.) Hair is very important in African American culture, and not everyone understands that, but to say that the shape of our hair is ""unnatural"" and that ""no one ever needed this before"" is really messed up. Additionally, it's a form of sneaky racism, because some people will say ""It isn't about race, because no one explicitly said 'Black'. It's just about hair shape."" But Black women know that because our hair has been treated as controversial and unnatural, and as something needing to be ""fixed"" or changed for so long, this is a racial issue; because it is a racial issue that primarily affects Black WOMEN, this should not be overlooked by feminists.

And don't get me started on FloJo's fingernails.

I want this to be an open conversation, because so many people don't understand the term ""white feminism"" and are quick to get defensive. White feminism is feminism that prioritizes the issues facing white women over any issues that face WOC and not specifically white women. Some might reply to this and say ""Well, if it doesn't affect all women, it's not a women's issue,"" but why? Do you really think that every cause that has been taken up by feminists has affected \*all\* women, or \*equally\* affected all women? I want this to be a conversation because a lot of people mean well and aren't trying to be malicious, but they don't understand that this is happening, and they inadvertently contribute to it.

Also, white women, though they are oppressed for their gender, do have privilege, and I know that's a sensitive word for some people."

They still use cultures instead of more in depth urine testing. People act like utis are no big deal, but the treatment for a chronic embedded UTI is 1-2 years of full dose antibiotics.

PeachyPlum3,h4ljqq4,1,"When it comes to anything regarding pain of the reproductive variety, from the moment puberty starts in a girl into a woman a lot of concerns are brushed to the side.

Hell, there are cases of women having appendicitis, pancreatitis, and much more that are mostly attributed to cramps or period related pains. Just because it is common does not mean it is normal.

On average PCOS and endometriosis can take anywhere from 3 to 12 years to be properly diagnosed. That said, pain management and proper treatment are another story.

I believe , if I recall correctly, there was a woman in Ireland who had endometriosis so badly that it left her wheelchair bound and essentially put a hold on her entire life. Her, like many women were pretty much denied a hysterectomy or proper sterilization procedures that would help her.

In fact, many sections in the first world second and third restricted woman from having access to any manner of sterilization or dominion over procedures regarding her reproductive organs. Some military still require a permission slip from the spouse, and many places to require input from even family members like their father or mother before they can get care.

Edit: bonus tidbit. Sometimes doctors are seemingly so lax on treatment options that they will simply suggest that a woman get pregnant and have a baby to try to fix the issue as if the uterus and whatever else you have going on down there will simply cure itself."
